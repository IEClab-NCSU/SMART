The sugar deoxyribose with the phosphate group forms the scaffold or backbone of the
            molecule (highlighted in yellow in the figure above). Bases point inward. Complementary
            bases form hydrogen bonds with each other within the double helix. See how the bigger
            bases (purines) pair with the smaller ones (pyrimidines). This keeps the width of the
            double helix constant. More specifically, A pairs with T and C pairs with G. As we
            discuss the function of DNA in subsequent sections, keep in mind that there is a
            chemical reason for specific pairing of bases.
