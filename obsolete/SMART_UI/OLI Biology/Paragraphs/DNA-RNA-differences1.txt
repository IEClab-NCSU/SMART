The tertiary structure of B-DNA has been described with a number of specific characteristics.
      These characteristics describe what is referred to as the B-helix. It is the most common
      structural form of double stranded DNA. RNA and hybrids of DNA with RNA have altered
      characteristics resulting from the substitution of a ribose for a deoxyribose in the backbone
      structure. The general characteristics found in the B-DNA are still present; however, slight
      differences in the specific characteristics result in dramatic changes in the overall
      structure of the helix.
