Representations of a molecule showing arrangement of atoms and
                                chemical bonds. Simple structures represent atoms by one leter
                                symbols and covalent bonds by lines. Three-dimensional structures
                                represent arrangment of atoms and bonds in three-dimensional space.
                                For example, water can be represented by any of the following
                                structures: H-O-H and 3D representations.
