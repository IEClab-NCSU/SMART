The slow phosphorus cycle involves the buildup, movement, and erosion of rocks.  Over time, phosphorus tends to follow the flow of water downhill.  Phosphorus-rich sediments build up on ocean and lake bottoms, forming phosphate rocks over time.  Seabird and bat colonies can also produce concentrated deposits of guano (excrement) that is very rich in phosphates.  Through slow geologic processes, rocks containing phosphorus can be lifted up to form new land masses and their erosion can make phosphates available to producers once again.
