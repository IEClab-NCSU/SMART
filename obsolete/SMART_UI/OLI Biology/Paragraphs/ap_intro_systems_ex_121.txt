The 
nervous

 and 
endocrine

 systems work together to control many of the body’s other organ systems through
            electrical signals and chemical messengers. The systems integrate with each other, so
            that control systems within the nervous system regulate many activities of the endocrine
            system and hormones of the endocrine system can affect some of the functions of the
            nervous system. The chemical messengers produced by each individual system are
            responsible for many homeostatic functions, through feedback mechanisms. The activities
            of the two systems coordinate many of the body’s metabolic activities.
