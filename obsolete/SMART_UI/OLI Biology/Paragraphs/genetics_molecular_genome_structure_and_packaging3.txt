Many bacteria contain smaller, circular DNA molecules, called plasmids, in addition to the large DNA molecule that is their chromosome.
            Plasmids can replicate independently of the large DNA and can be transferred to other
            cells. Some naturally occurring plasmids carry genes encoding toxins and proteins that
            make bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
