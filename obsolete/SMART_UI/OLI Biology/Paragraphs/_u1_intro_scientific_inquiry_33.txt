The experimental group receives the vaccine, but how can we know if the vaccine made a
			difference? Many things may change HPV infection rates in a group of people over time.
			To clearly show that the vaccine was effective in helping the experimental group, we
			need to include in our study an otherwise similar control group that does not get the
			treatment. We can then compare the two groups and determine if the vaccine made a
			difference. The control group shows us what happens in the absence of the
			factor under study.
