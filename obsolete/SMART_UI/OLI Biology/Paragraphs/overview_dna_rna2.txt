Both DNA and RNA are linear polymers of building blocks. Each block contains a planer nucleotide base that is joined to a sugar, either a deoxyribose in the case of DNA or a ribose in the case of RNA.  Each block is joined by a oxygen-phosphate-oxygen bridge.  The alternating ribose-phosphate-ribose is referred to as the backbone of the nucleic acid polymer, in much the same way the N, alpha-Carbon, and carbonyl atoms in an amino acid form the backbone of a protein.  Similarly, the nucleotide bases are analogous to the amino acid sidechains.
