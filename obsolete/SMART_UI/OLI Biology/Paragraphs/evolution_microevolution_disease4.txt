Reverse transcriptase converts the HIV virus RNA into DNA
				that can be recognized by the infected human cell’s DNA replication machinery as
				well as human RNA polymerase.
Integrase inserts the DNA made from the HIV RNA (using
				reverse transcriptase) into one of the human chromosomes. In this way, the virus
				(which is not living - see Application Spotlight: Viruses) tricks the human host cell into producing more viral RNA, which
				the virus cannot do itself.
HIV’s protease cuts the viral proteins that are manufactured
				by the host cell into their functional forms.
