The pea plant example only looks at one trait of the plants, seed color, but there are
			many other genes present in this population. A gene pool includes all of the genes and alleles in a population, not just
			those for a particular trait. So the gene pool for this pea plant population actually
			contains genes and alleles that influence thousands of different traits. Some of these
			traits are visible, such as plant height and flower color. Other genes may determine how
			resistant the plants are to diseases and pests, how they respond to drought or freezing,
			and many more features that are important to peas - and to gardeners.
