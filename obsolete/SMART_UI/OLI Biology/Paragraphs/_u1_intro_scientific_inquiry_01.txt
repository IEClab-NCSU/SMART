Science is a powerful tool used to understand the natural world. It is the process that
            has resulted in the knowledge we are exploring in this course. However, the process of
            science does have limitations. In other words, there are some questions that science
            cannot be used to answer. For example, science cannot answer questions about
            supernatural things. It also cannot be used to make moral or aesthetic judgments. While
            questions of these types may be important for humans to explore, the process of science
            cannot be used to study them.
