Now that we have a better understanding of what biology is, it is next important to ask why we are interested in 
			studying it.  Why does it matter if we learn biology?  This lies in the fact that we (humans) are living organisms, 
			and understanding the principles of biology helps us to better understand ourselves and the world around us.  Have 
			you ever been sick with an infection and told  you needed to take an antibiotic to help you get better?  Well, some 
			scientists have studied infections and found that they are caused by microorganisms (very small life forms).  Other 
			scientists have studied how these microorganisms live so that medications could be developed that will kill the 
			microorganisms but not harm you.  Biology helps to keep us well.  Have you ever heard a news report about acid rain 
			and wondered is it really that big of a deal?  There are scientists who study ecology and are investigating what 
			happens to the health of eco-systems when acid rain falls.  Have you ever wondered if there could be life in space, 
			on the moon, or on Mars?  There are scientists who study astrobiology to help answer those questions.  Do you know 
			someone who has cancer?  Cell biologists are helping to find cures and treatments for cancer so that in the future 
			cancer will not be a deadly disease.  In short, biology and science are all around us.  To better understand the 
			world around us and your own life and health, it is essential that you know something of the principles of biology 
			that are at work all day, everyday day in our bodies and on the planet.
