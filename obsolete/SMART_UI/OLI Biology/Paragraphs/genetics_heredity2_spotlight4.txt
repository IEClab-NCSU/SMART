The environment also affects human genes. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that acts
                    inside brain cells, lowers anxiety and depression during traumatic times.
                    Mutations in the serotonin transporter gene may cause a reduced ability to cope
                    with stress. That does not mean that the person is always depressed, but if the
                    environment produces stress, the person may become depressed more easily than a
                    person with unmutated serotonin transporter genes.
