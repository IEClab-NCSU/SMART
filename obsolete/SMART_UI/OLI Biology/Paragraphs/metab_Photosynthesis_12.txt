Some photosynthetic organisms (such as most algae and cyanobacteria) live in water. Their
			cells are equipped with pigments to absorb light, and they absorb water and other
			nutrients directly across the cell membrane. They are faced with a challenge involving
			the attenuation (loss) of light energy with increasing depth. As a result, many algae
			and cyanobacteria have adaptations that keep them floating near the waterâ€™s surface.
