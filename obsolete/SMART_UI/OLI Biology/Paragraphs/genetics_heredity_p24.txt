In this unit, you will learn about the genotype and phenotype
            of diploid organisms. Diploid cells have two copies of each chromosome; haploid cells have only one copy of
            each chromosome. Because diploid cells have two copies of each chromosome, they also
            have two copies of every gene. One set of chromosomes (and, therefore, one copy of each
            gene) is from the mother (or egg) and one set is from the father (or sperm). Diploid
            cells can have two of the same alleles of a gene, or they can have two different alleles
            of a gene. Cells that have the same allele are called homozygous
            (“homo” meaning "same," and “zygous” referring to the reproductive cells produced from
            meiosis). These cells are called homozygous because all of their reproductive cells
                (gametes)
            will have identical alleles. Cells with different alleles are called
                    heterozygous (“hetero” meaning "different") because they
            will produce reproductive cells that have different alleles of this gene.
