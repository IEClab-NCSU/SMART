Three different conditions may exist in the relationship between the solute (ion)
			concentration and solvent (water) concentration across a membrane. Isotonic, hypertonic
			and hypotonic refer to the relative concentration of the solute (small molecules) in the
			extracellular (outside) space surrounding the cell relative to the solute concentration
			inside the cell. In an isotonic solution, the concentration of the solute and therefore
			solvent water (water potential) is the same on both sides. A hypotonic solution is one
			whose solute concentration is lower (water concentration is higher [i.e. high water
			potential]) in the extracellular space than inside the cell. Because the water (the
			solvent) can more easily pass through the membrane than can the solute (ions), the net
			flow is spontaneous in the direction of the solvent (water) moving from its higher
			concentration (high water potential) outside the cell to the inside of the cell.
			Conversely, a hypertonic solution refers to an extracellular solution with a higher
			solute concentration (lower water concentration [i.e. low water potential]) outside the
			cell than inside the cell. In this case, the more permeable solvent, water, would flow
			spontaneously out of the cell toward the low water potential to dilute the solute
			molecules and create an equal concentration of solute molecules on both sides of the
			membrane.
