In the remainder of this Unit, you will continue to explore some of the most
					basic principles of Biology. You will explore the difference between living and
					non-living things, and we will discuss the Hierarchy of Life. That is to say,
					you will begin to see how all of life is built from smaller things that combine
					to form larger more complex ones. You will be introduced to the common themes of
					the course: Energy, Pathways and Regulation. You will find that these three
					concepts appear over and over again throughout the course. Lastly, we will learn
					about the Scientific Method. In this module youâ€™ll learn about some of the key
					tools, ideas, and problem-solving methods that are used by biologists to ask and
					answer scientific questions about life.
