The mainchain atoms of glycine are highlighted in yellow and its sidechain (H)
					is highlighted in green. All amino acids have the same mainchain atoms, but
					differ in the sidechains. For clarity, the hydrogen is omitted in the remaining
					drawings. 
Non-polar amino acids
					are highlighted in grey, 
Aromatic amino acids
					are highlighted in cyan,
Polar amino acids are
					highlighted in purple,
Amino acids with acidic
						sidechains are highlighted in red, and
Amino acids with basic
						sidechains are highlighted in blue. 
The amino acids cysteine and proline, which are shown at the bottom of the page
					have unique properties. Cysteine can form covalent S-S disulfide bond,
					stabilizing the protein structure. In the case of proline, the sidechain
					attaches to its own nitrogen, making proline an amino acid.
