Organic molecules and oxygen (O2) are inputs to the cellular respiration
			pathway and produce (i.e., output) carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O),
			and energy comprising ATP and heat. Note that cellular respiration is an
				aerobic process which means that oxygen (O2) is required. As
			the reaction proceeds, high energy electrons and hydrogen ions
				(H+) are transferred from the organic molecule to the O2.
			Because the rapid transfer of the electrons and H+ would generate an unusable
			form of energy (heat), the transfer utilizes enzyme carriers called
				NAD+ and FAD+. Use of these carriers allows
			for the controlled transfer of the electrons and H+ and the most efficient
			production of ATP.
