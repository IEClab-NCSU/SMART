These are deep issues that can’t be resolved simply. However, they
            do not imply any scientific
           disagreement about evolution. Some people may claim
                that evolution is somehow in dispute among scientists; they may argue that evolution
                is “just” a theory. Please recall that the scientific definition of the word
                “theory” is vastly different from its usage in popular culture. As a 
                    scientific theory
                       , evolution holds a great deal of weight. It has been supported
                        over and over again through many different kinds of observations and experiments. It
                        helps explain a wide range of phenomena and suggests new ideas that can be applied
                        to solve practical problems. The theory continues to be refined as new evidence
                        comes in, but the major outlines of evolution seem likely to endure.
