A protein that acts as a catalyst for chemical reactions in
                                biological organisms. Enzymes increase the speed of chemical
                                reactions. They are proteins that bind to a chemical (called a
                                substrate) and chemically modify the substrate into an end product.
                                The substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme. Enzymes speed
                                up the rate of chemical reactions that support life.
