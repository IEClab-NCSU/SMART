Any variable in an experiment that is kept the same between the
                                control and experimental groups. For example, in a study to test a
                                drug, the control and experimental groups would each contain
                                subjects (people) of similar ages and similar numbers of men and
                                women. Additionally, scientists may also put all of the study
                                participants on the same diet and exercise plan.
