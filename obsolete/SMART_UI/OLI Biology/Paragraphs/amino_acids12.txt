Note that after the amino acid has been incorporated into the protein, the
					charges on the â€“amino and the carboxyl groups have disappeared. Thus the mainchain
					atoms have become polar functional groups. Since each residue in a protein has
					exactly the same mainchain atoms, the functional properties of a protein must
					arise from the different sidechain groups.
