Anabolic reactions (also referred to as "anabolism") use
					energy to build more complex molecules from relatively simple raw materials.
					Synthetic, or anabolic pathways consume energy and are generally
					reductive, requiring electrons. “Anabolic” and “catabolic”
					sound similar but are opposites. To remember the difference, it may help to
					think about how “anabolic steroids” promote the buildup of muscle mass. All of
					the complex molecules of life — carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids —
					are generated by anabolic reactions. Anabolic reactions are central to processes
					like photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and DNA replication.
