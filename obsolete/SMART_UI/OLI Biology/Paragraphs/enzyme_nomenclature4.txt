To further clarify the name of the enzyme, the name of the substrate or product is often included in
      the name. For example, the enzyme that oxidizes succinate is called succinate dehydrogenase.
      Keep in mind that most reactions in pathways are reversible, so the name may describe the
      reverse reaction. Lastly, in cases when enzymes bind more than one substrate, the name can
      also suggest the co-substrate. For examples, dehydrogenases will use NAD+ or FAD as
      co-substrates.
