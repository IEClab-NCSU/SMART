        		Hydrochloric Acid, like sodium chloride, is a strong electrolyte that completely dissociates in aqueous solution into charged ions. It is also a strong acid because when it completely dissociates, it is also completely donating all of its protons. Some molecules are weak electrolytes and exist in equilibrium between the starting molecule and its dissociated parts. For molecules that are weak electrolytes and act as acids, the ratio of the dissociated parts and the parent molecule is a constant in neutral water for each separate structure. The dissociation can be seen as an acid dissociating into a proton and the conjugate base:
