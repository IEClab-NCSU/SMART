An amino acid with a side chain that contains a ring structure with
                                conjugated double bonds. Conjugated double bonds refer to the
                                alternating arrangement of bonds in a molecule: double-single-double
                                bond. The benzene ring is the best known example of an aromatic
                                group. Two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, contain the
                                benzene ring. Aromatic rings can include atoms other than
                                carbon.
