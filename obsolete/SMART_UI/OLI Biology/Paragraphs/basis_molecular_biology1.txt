Modern molecular biology is built upon our understanding of the structure and function of DNA
      (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) and the enzymes and proteins that interact
      with these structures. In this section of the course the structures of RNA and DNA will be
      explored along with the processes by which they are used to transmit information.
