What does your score mean? If you are underweight, do not pat yourself on the back. It is
			important that you have adequate body fat and muscle, and your low weight may be a sign
			of a serious problem. You should see a doctor and focus on the important end goal: your
			long-term health. For additional information about how to respond to an overweight or
			obese rating, visit the National Heart Lung and Blood Instituteâ€™s webpage on Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
