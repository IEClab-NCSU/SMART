This is an image of planet Earth taken from outer space. Biology is the
							study of life and all of the interactions, systems, and chemicals that
							are necessary to sustain planet Earth. In this course, you will come to
							see the Earth as a living planet, with life changing its rocks and
							atmosphere. You will learn about the fundamental principles of biology
							so that you can have a better understanding of the role biology plays in
							your everyday life - and in the life of Planet Earth.
