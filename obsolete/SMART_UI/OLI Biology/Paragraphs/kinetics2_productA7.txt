 This equation can also be represented graphically by the hyperbolic curve
					illustrated below. This curve can be dissected into two parts: a region at the
					beginning where the velocity of the reaction increases proportionately with the
					amount of substrate present initially in the reaction, and the later region of
					the curve, at high substrate concentration, where the rate of the reaction is
					independent of the substrate concentration. This latter region defines
					saturation of the enzyme by substrate and the velocity approaches the value of
						Vmax.
