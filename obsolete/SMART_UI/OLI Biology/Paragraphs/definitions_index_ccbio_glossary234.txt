An amino acid with non-polar side chains contain, primarily,
                                hydrocarbons and no polar functional groups containing
                                electronegative atoms. Note that the term “non-polar” refers only to
                                the side chain, while the amino acid as a whole is charged at
                                physiological pH due to the carboxyl and amino groups.
