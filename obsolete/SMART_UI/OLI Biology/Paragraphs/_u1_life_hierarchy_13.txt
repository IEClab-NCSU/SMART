As we ascend to more and more complex levels, emergent
						properties appear. These are characteristics of a system that do not
					appear in any of its component parts. The separated parts of an automobile
					amount to a heap of junk. Only properly assembled, with gas, the right key, and
					a human driver, does the car fulfill its function. A more biological example
					would be life, an emergent property that appears at the
					cellular level. Molecules are not alive, but they are the components of life.
					Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle said “The whole is much greater than the sum
					of its parts.” In biology, this is a constant theme: we can learn much about a
					system by looking at its details, but we also must step back and look at the big
					picture to truly understand the workings of life.
