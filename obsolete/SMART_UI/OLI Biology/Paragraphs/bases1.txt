The backbone structure of both DNA and RNA shows variability according to the composition
          of X in the structure given on the previous page. X represents a set of nitrogenous bases.
          The bases are divided into two fundamental ring structures: purines (2 fused aromatic
          rings) and pyrimidines (a single aromatic ring). The differences in the bases, which are
          only found attached to a sugar, give rise to the second major variation in the difference
          between DNA and RNA.
