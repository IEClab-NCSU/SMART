Experimentally it is possible to measure this stability by following the melting of DNA with
      increasing temperature. Below is a graph of the melting of DNA that coincides with an increase
      in the ultraviolet (UV) absorbance of the DNA at 260 nm. The increase in absorbance is
      referred to as the hyperchromic effect and is a measure of the breaking of the hydrogen bonds
      between the bases and the separation of the two strands.
