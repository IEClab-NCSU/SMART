Substances that inhibit enzymes in a central pathway can have deadly effects for
					the cell or organism. For instance, the potent poisons cyanide and arsenic are
					inhibitors of cellular respiration. Lack of regulation, or dysregulation, of
					metabolic pathways can lead to serious diseases. Examples include
					phenylketonuria (PKU), Tay-Sachs disease, galactosemia, and maple syrup urine
					disease. Each of these is an inherited condition in which an altered gene
					produces an enzyme that does not function normally. As a result, metabolism is
					disrupted and health problems occur.
