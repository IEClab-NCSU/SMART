An electrical signal from the nervous system is necessary to cause a skeletal
                    muscle contraction. The area where the nerve meets the muscle to stimulate it is
                    termed neuromuscular junction. When a nerve signal reaches the
                    neuromuscular junction, the muscle fiber is stimulated and the muscle contracts.
