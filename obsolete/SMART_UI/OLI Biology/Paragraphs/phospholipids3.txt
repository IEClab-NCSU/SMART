Lipid molecules are slightly soluble to insoluble in water. Lipids are hydrophobic because the molecules consist of long, 16-18 carbon, hydrocarbon chains (or backbones) with only a small amount of oxygen containing groups. Lipids serve many functions in organisms. Fats (or triglycerides) are used to store energy. Phospholipids and steroids are the key components of cell membranes.  Lipds are also the major components of waxes, pigments, and steroid hormones.
