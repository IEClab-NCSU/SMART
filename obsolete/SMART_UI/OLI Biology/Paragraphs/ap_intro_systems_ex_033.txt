When we inhale, air passes through the nose or mouth into the pharynx,
                    
larynx

, 
trachea

, lungs, and into smaller and smaller airways termed bronchi and then bronchioles, 
                    until it reaches the air sacs, or 
alveoli

. Only a single cell thick,
                    the walls of the alveoli allow the oxygen in air to diffuse into the blood, and
                    the cardiovascular system carries it to each cell in the body.
