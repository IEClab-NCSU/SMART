To us, it seems that the sun has burned forever and will always keep shining.
					However, the sun is fueled by nuclear energy generated by atoms colliding in its
					incredibly hot core. Eventually, the supply of fuel in the sun will be depleted
					and our sunâ€™s long life will end. This illustrates an inescapable fact about
					energy: it tends to lose quality over time. It dissipates, spreading out in
					space, and loses its intensity.
