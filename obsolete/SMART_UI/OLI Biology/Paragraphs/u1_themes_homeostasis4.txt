Environmental conditions can also affect cellular homeostasis. If the cellâ€™s surroundings
            change quickly, conditions inside the cell may be temporarily disturbed. Organisms react
            to these changes in a corrective way: they detect changes and do something to oppose
            them. For example, when you get cold, your muscles start to contract in rapid bursts,
            causing you to shiver. The process of shivering then generates heat that warms you back
            up again. As a result of this and other adjustments, your temperature is maintained
            close to 99 degrees F (Fahrenheit) [37 degrees C (Celsius)]. At this temperature, your enzymes work very
            efficiently.
