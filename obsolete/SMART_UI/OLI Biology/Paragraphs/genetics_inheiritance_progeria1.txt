HGPS is an extremely rare (one case per eight million live births) autosomal dominant
            disorder characterized by accelerated aging. The disorder is caused in the gene coding
            for lamin A, a protein involved in chromosome organization. The defective protein
            accumulates in the nuclear membrane of the cells, affecting many cellular processes.
            Symptoms start before age two, with thinning skin and weak muscles and bones. Aging is
            estimated to be eight to 10 times faster than normal. Patients die in their teens from
            stroke or heart attack. How do people “get” progeria? It is important to remember that
            because progeria patients die at a very young age, progeria is not inherited, but only
            appears as a random mutation. This explains its fortunately very low incidence.
