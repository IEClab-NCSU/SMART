Why do cells divide? In the discussion about the cell cycle, you learned that
					cells undergo different phases, during which they grow, duplicate their genetic
					material, and then divide. In single celled organisms, cell division results in
					two new individuals. Cell division in multicellular organisms is more complex.
					Most cells in multicellular organisms are somatic cells. Somatic cells
					consist of all the non-reproductive cells in an organism; for example, tissue
					cells, nerve cells, and blood cells. When somatic cells divide, they go through
					the process of mitosis, which is a type of cell division that results
					in two identical daughter cells.
