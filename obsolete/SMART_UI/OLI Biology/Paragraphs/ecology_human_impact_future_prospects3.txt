Fertility (which corresponds to the birth rate) is the main factor that
                    determines modern and future rates of population growth. Since about 1900, birth
                    rates have declined in industrialized, high-income nations. Why? Education and
                    economic opportunity for women, access to contraception, and changing economic
                    pressures have all contributed to reduced fertility in these countries. With low
                    rates of death and birth, populations are stable or even declining in many of
                    the worldâ€™s most affluent nations. In less developed low- and middle-income
                    nations, fertility rates are still high enough to generate rapid population
                    growth. In addition, these countries have populations with many young people
                    just now entering reproductive age. Therefore the populations of these nations
                    will continue to grow rapidly for years into the future.
