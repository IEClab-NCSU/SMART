As you recall, genetic information is contained in DNA, which in eukaryotic cells
					are bound to special proteins called histones. The combination of DNA and
					histone proteins is called chromatin. During the S-phase
					of the cell cycle, the chromatin is loose, to facilitate DNA replication.
					Chromatin can condense to form chromosomes during nuclear
					division. Chromosomes have a typical appearance and can be organized in a
					karyotype.
