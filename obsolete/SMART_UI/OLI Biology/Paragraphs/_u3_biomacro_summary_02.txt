In this unit, you learned about the four classes of biological macromolecules that form
			the building blocks of the cell — the cell from a molecular point of view. Chemistry is fundamental to
			life’s unity; it helps us grasp how all cells maintain a stable internal environment,
			grow, reproduce, and process energy. Chemistry also helps to explain the incredible
			diversity of life. In particular, an understanding of protein structure helps us see how
			life takes on such endless variety.
