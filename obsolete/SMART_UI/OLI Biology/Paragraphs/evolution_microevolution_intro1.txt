Before we begin our exploration of microevolution, letâ€™s review a few principles that we
			have already covered in this course. The principles of evolution are based in genes;
			therefore, it is important that we remember that genes are segments of DNA
			that have "meaning." Genes are sequences of DNA that encode particular
				RNA and protein molecules, which work together to give a
			cell and an organism its characteristics and functions, whether they be physical,
			chemical, or behavioral. Most genes have multiple forms, called alleles,, discussed
			previously in the Heredity module of the Classical Genetics
			unit. For example, pea plants have a gene that determines seed color, and the different
			forms (alleles) of that gene are "green seed" and "yellow seed."
