There are exceptions to the law of independent assortment. We know now that peas
                    have seven chromosomes, and Mendel happened to study traits coded by genes on
                    different chromosomes, or on distant positions of the same chromosome, which
                    assort independently due to frequent crossing-over. Genes that are very close
                    together on a chromosome do not assort independently, and are said to be
                        linked. The closer they are, the more probable that the gametes
                    will receive parental combinations of alleles of those genes. All the genes in a
                    chromosome are called a linkage group. Peas have seven linkage
                    groups.
