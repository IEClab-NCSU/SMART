Organic marcromolecules that are largely nonpolar (electrons are
                                evenly distributed amongst atoms in a molecule) and as a result are
                                hydrophobic (“water-fearing”). Lipids perform many functions in the
                                cell including: storage of energy for long-term use in the form of
                                fats, insulation from the environment, and building blocks for
                                hormones. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and
                                steroids.
