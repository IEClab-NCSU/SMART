The structure of the 20 common amino acids is shown in the table. Click on any of
					the 2D drawings of an amino acid below and the 3D structure will be
				presented in the Jmol window on the right. (Note: you may need to click twice the
				first time you use this tool.) Initially, a 2D drawing of the simplest amino acid,
				glycine, is shown in the upper left and its 3D structure is shown on the right.
