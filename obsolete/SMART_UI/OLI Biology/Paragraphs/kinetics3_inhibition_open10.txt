In competitive inhibition the second molecule binds in the active site
					thus preventing the substrate from binding. The regulatory molecule competes
					with the substrate for the active site. This decreases the rate at which the
					enzyme can convert the substrate to product because the enzyme spends part of
					the time unable to bind the substrate. This can be seen in the graph below
					plotted as the dashed red line. The occupancy of the binding pocket is in
					equilibrium between the binding of the substrate or the inhibitor. As you can
					see from the curve the maximum velocity is unchanged, but the substrate
					concentration required to reach maximum velocity is increased.
