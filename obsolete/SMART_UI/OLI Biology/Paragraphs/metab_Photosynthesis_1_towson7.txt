Water and light are essential for building sugar
					(C6H12O6), but neither of these contain carbon.
				To build sugar, photosynthesis needs a carbon source. Where do plants get this
				carbon? Do they get it from the soil, through their roots (like they get water)?
				Jean-Baptist van Helmont designed an experiment to test this in the 1600’s. He
				planted a tree in a pot and watered it. He measured the weight of the soil and the
				tree both before and after the experiment. Applying the principle of conservation of
				matter, van Helmont knew that the tree’s carbon couldn’t just appear from nowhere.
				If the tree “ate” soil, then as it grew, the soil’s mass should decline by a similar
				amount.
