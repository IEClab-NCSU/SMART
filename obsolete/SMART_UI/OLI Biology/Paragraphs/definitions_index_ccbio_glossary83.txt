An increase or decrease in the density of a chemical substance within
                                a given region. Cells often maintain concentration gradients of
                                hydrogen ions across their membranes. When a gradient exists, the
                                ions or other chemical substances involved tend to move from where
                                they are more concentrated to where they are less concentrated.
