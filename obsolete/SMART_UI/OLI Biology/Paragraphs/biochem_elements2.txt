 Atoms differ from one another in their number of protons, electrons, neutrons, and chemical properties
			which affect the ability of atoms to combine to form substances. An atom is the smallest
			unit of an element that retains all of the properties of that element. So, an
				element is a substance that is composed of a single type of atom. But,
			how do you know what kind of atom you have? It is easy! Count the number of protons in the
			atomâ€™s nucleus, and that will tell you what kind of element that atom is.
			The number of protons in an atom is denoted by the atomic number displayed
			for each element in the periodic table.
