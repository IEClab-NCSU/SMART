Molecules can be divided into four categories with regard to their ability to
					cross the plasma membrane. The first category are non-polar molecules. These
					hydrophobic molecules can easily cross the membrane because they interact
					favorably with the non-polar lipids. Note that these molecules can accumulate in
					the membrane because they interact so well with the lipids. The second category
					are small polar molecules. Although they donâ€™t interact with the lipids, their
					small size allows them to pass through small temporary holes in the membrane.
					The third category are large polar molecules. These have difficulty crossing
					the membrane because of their size and poor interaction with the lipids. The
					last category are ionic compounds, their charge interacts very unfavorably with
					the lipids, making it very difficult for them to cross the membrane.
