Meiosis I is often referred to as the reduction
						division. It is during this stage that the number of chromosomes in the
					parent cell are divided in half because homologous chromosomes are
					separated. One homologue with its sister
					chromatid go to one daughter cell while the other homologue with its sister
					chromatid go to the other daughter cell. Meiosis II is extremely
					similar to mitosis, except that there are half as many chromosomes. In
						Meiosis II, sister chromatids are
					separated from each other.
