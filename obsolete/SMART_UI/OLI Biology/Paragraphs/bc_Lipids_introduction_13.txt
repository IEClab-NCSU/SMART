Lipids include a distinct group of compounds that are united by two common
					features. First, they are largely nonpolar in nature. This is
					because they are hydrocarbons that include many nonpolar carbon-carbon or
					carbon-hydrogen bonds. Second, because lipids are nonpolar, they are also hydrophobic (water-hating), or insoluble in
					water.
