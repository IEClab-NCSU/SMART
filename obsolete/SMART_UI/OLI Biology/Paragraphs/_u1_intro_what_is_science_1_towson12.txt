Science is theory-laden. Theories and laws play a central role in the interpretation of new observations or discoveries. Scientific laws describe consistent 
                    relationships or patterns in nature. Scientific theories differ from colloquial or “everyday” theories. Scientific theories are well-supported explanations 
                    of natural phenomenon based on large bodies of empirical evidence. Everyday (colloquial) theories are most often based on a few untested personal experiences,
                    anecdotal stories and legends.
