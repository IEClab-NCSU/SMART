Why do children look like their parents? How do rose growers get so many different colors
            of roses—pink, red, white, yellow, purple, peach, striped, and many more? How can there
            be different colored puppies within one litter? Genetic information (DNA) carried in the
            parents’ cells is passed on to the next generation. This genetic information helps
            determine many of the characteristics of the offspring. In people, for instance, DNA is
            responsible for a child’s height and skin pigmentation. It also helps determine the
            overall health of the child by regulating many physiological characteristics such as the
            condition of the heart and lungs, as well as brain and blood chemistry.
