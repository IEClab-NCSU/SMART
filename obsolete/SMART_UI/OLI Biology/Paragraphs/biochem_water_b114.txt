The carboxylate group (COOH) on the left interacts strongly with water, while the remaining
					part of the molecule is very hydrophobic and is forced away from water. Fatty
					acids form structures in solution called micelles. These
					spherical structures have the hydrophilic part exposed to
					water on the surface of the sphere and bury the
						hydrophobic part in the center of the sphere.
