When there is demand from glucose protein phosphorylation occurs, signalling the release
        of glucose from glycogen in the liver. Therefore the phosphorylated state of glycogen
        phosphorylase must be the active form of the enzyme so that glucose is released from
        glycogen. To insure that both synthetic and degradative pathways are not active at the same
        time we would expect that the phosphorylated state of glycogen synthase must be inactive.
During periods of high blood sugar levels, hormonal signalling causes the storage of
        glucose in glycogen by leading to dephosphorylation of enzymes in the cell. This
        dephosphorylation activates glycogen synthase and inactivates glycogen phosphorylase, again
        insuring that only one direction is active at a time.
