The study of biology, the science of life, takes us through both time
			and space. You have learned about evolution, which occurs (and is still occurring) over
			a huge span of time. You have learned about micro-organisms and species that cannot be
			seen without a microscope as well as species of great size, like redwood trees. To best
			understand biology, you need to apply an “interdisciplinary approach.” For example,
			concepts from chemistry and physics are both required to explain biological systems at
			many levels. Each level of “life” has unique emergent properties that arise from complex
			interactions at lower levels.
