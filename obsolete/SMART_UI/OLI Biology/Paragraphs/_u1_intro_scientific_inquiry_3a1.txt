A variable is a characteristic
            of a subject (in this case, of a person in the study) that can vary over time or among
            individuals. Sometimes a variable takes the form of a category, such as male or female;
            often a variable can be measured precisely, such as body height. Ideally, only one
            variable is different between the control group and the experimental group in a
            scientific experiment. Otherwise, the researchers will not be able to determine which
            variable caused any differences seen in the results. For example, imagine that the
            people in the control group were, on average, much more sexually active than the people
            in the experimental group. If, at the end of the experiment, the control group had a
            higher rate of HPV infection, could you confidently determine why? Maybe the
            experimental subjects were protected by the vaccine, but maybe they were protected by
            their low level of sexual contact.
