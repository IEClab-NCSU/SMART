Although some cholesterol is essential for healthy physiological functioning, excess
			cholesterol can lead to health problems. Because cholesterol is hydrophobic, it cannot
			be easily transported through the body in the blood stream. A carrier is required to
			transport cholesterol around the body to the cells that need it. These carriers are
			called lipoproteins. You can think of lipoproteins as cholesterol
			boats that carry cholesterol to the body’s cells (where it can be used to build or
			repair cell membranes or synthesize steroid hormones). Lipoproteins that carry
			cholesterol to the cell for use are called low-density
				lipoproteins (or LDL). LDL is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, because
			excess LDL levels have been linked to plaque deposition in the arteries, which can
			result in heart disease. Another type of lipoprotein, known as high-density lipoprotein
			(or HDL) transports cholesterol to the liver, where it is often
			turned into bile salts and excreted. HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol,
			because high blood concentrations of HDL have been linked to a decreased risk of heart
			disease. Exercise and proper diet can increase HDL levels. Increasing intake of
			unsaturated fats and decreasing intake of saturated fats is also a good strategy for
			increasing HDL levels.
