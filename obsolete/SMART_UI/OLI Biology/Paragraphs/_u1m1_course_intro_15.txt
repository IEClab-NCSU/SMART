Atoms and molecules are not alive. After exploring the world of atoms and
					molecules, you will learn how these building blocks are put together to
					construct the fundamental unit of life: the cell. The cellular level of
					organization is the first time all the characteristics of life emerge, resulting
					in a structure that is able to maintain its own internal constancy. In Unit
						4: The Cell, you will learn how the unique structures that make up a
					cell enable it to maintain homeostasis and carry out the varied functions of
					life.
