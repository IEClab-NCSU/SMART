Pure water is said to be “neutral.” This means it is neither acidic nor basic
					because it has equal concentrations of H+ and OH-. Some
					substances can dissolve in water and they will not disturb the balance between
						H+ and OH-. However, other compounds disturb this
					balance. Some compounds, when added to water, cause an increase of hydrogen ions
						(H+) in the solution. These compounds are called acids. Other
					compounds, when added to water, cause a decrease in hydrogen ions
					(H+) in the solution. These compounds are called bases. Some bases
					accept H+ directly, but others release hydroxide ions
					(OH-) that then combine with H+ to produce water. The end
					result is the same. When the base is dissolved in water, the concentration of
						H+ ions goes down. A compound that does not result in a net gain
					or loss of hydrogen ions (H+) when in aqueous solution is said to be
					neutral; it does not alter the acidity of the water.
