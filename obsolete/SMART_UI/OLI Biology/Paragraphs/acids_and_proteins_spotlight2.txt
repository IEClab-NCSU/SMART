Lactase breaks lactose into galactose and glucose by adding a water molecule to
                    the bond between the two sugars. Without adequate lactase, ingested lactose from
                    milk and cheese is not broken down, and therefore cannot be absorbed in the
                    small intestine. Instead, the lactose goes to the large intestine, where it is
                    eaten by bacteria that live there. After metabolizing the lactose, the bacteria
                    produce large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which results in significant
                    discomfort for the individual lacking lactase.
