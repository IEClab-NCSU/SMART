DNA synthesis in biological systems is a very directed process controlled by specific
          enzymes that both dictate where synthesis begins and the exact structural conditions
          required to undertake DNA synthesis. Knowledge of these conditions and the process
          involved in DNA synthesis has become the basis for understanding other biological
          processes involving DNA and in the design of a set of tools essential to the advancement
          of the study of modern molecular biology.
