Evolution builds on what you already know. It is a scientific theory that explores life
            on a different scale and provides another layer of explanation (Table 1). First, it goes
            beyond the brief lifetimes of individual organisms. Instead, evolution considers how
            life changes from one generation to the next and how these changes accumulate over very
            long time scales. Second, evolution is focused on collections of individuals:
            populations, species, and larger taxonomic groups (for example, birds or flowering
            plants). Evolution also adds another layer of explanation to biological thinking. So far
            we have focused mainly on “how” questions. How does a cell maintain homeostasis? How is
            information passed from parents to offspring, and how is that information used to
            construct living cells? Evolution helps us answer “why” questions: Why do cells of very
            different organisms have so much in common? Why are cave fish blind? Rather than taking
            the features of life as a starting point, evolution asks why those features exist today
            and how they originated in the past.
