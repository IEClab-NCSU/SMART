In this unit you have learned what biology is and how it fits into science and society. Biology
			is a science focused on life. It provides us with many practical benefits involving
			health, environmental issues, and much more. For example, understanding life at its many
			levels can help improve medical treatments or predict how ecosystems will respond to
			global warming. This course will focus on some of the foundations of biology: chemistry,
			cells, and metabolism. In the past, life was recognized in animals and plants but
			microscopic life forms were unknown. Today, our definition of life centers on the cell.
			This structure is the basic unit of organization for all life forms, large and small. In
			addition to being made of cells, life grows using raw materials and energy, reproduces
			using DNA as its genetic material, and senses and responds to changes in the external
			environment. Viruses, because they depend on cells for their reproduction, do not fully
			meet this definition of “life.” Knowledge of bacteria and their cell biology has allowed
			major advances in public health and medicine. For example, we now can selectively use
			antibiotics to control infectious bacterial diseases. These drugs cannot be used against
			viruses, and their misuse can lead to the evolution of resistance among bacteria.
