Physical traits an organism displays are ultimately determined by the DNA
							found within the organismâ€™s cells. In this unit, we will connect
							heredity to DNA, the genetic material of the cell. We will specifically
							explore DNA function and figure out how DNA determines the heritable
							traits that individual organisms can pass to their offspring.
