Macroevolution involves bigger changes that occur more slowly and cannot be
            directly observed in most cases. It is the long-term evolution of biological lineages
            and includes the origin and extinction of species and larger taxonomic groups. According
            to current scientific thinking, all of life’s diversity can be traced back to one or a
            few original cellular life forms. From this starting point, macroevolution has done a
            huge job in producing life’s diversity. It has had a long time to work: scientists
            estimate that life on Earth is well over 3 billion years old. Over vast time spans, slow
            and subtle processes have produced the spectacular diversity of modern life.
