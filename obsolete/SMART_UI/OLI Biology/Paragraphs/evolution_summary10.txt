In this unit, we have only scratched the surface of evolutionary theory. Evolution is a
            slow and often very complex process. Disputes about what happened in the past can be
            evaluated by sifting through the available crime-scene evidence (fossils and genes, for
            example). But there are no living human eyewitnesses to past macroevolution. Therefore
            scientists will continue to engage in lively debate about the details of exactly how
            evolution occurred. In particular, the issues surrounding speciation are quite complex
            and there are many competing ideas about the best way to recognize and define biological
            lineages.
