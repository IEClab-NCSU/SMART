Epigenetic regulation and inheritance has been linked to cancer and obesity, aging and
            longevity, and other important processes. It is the key mechanism for interactions
            between genes and environment. Unlike the genome, which remains fairly unchanged
            throughout an organismâ€™s life cycle, the epigenome (consisting of the pattern of DNA
            methylation and histone modifications) is dynamic, responds to the environment, and can
            be heritable.
