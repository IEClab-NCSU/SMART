Molecules can be divided into four categories with regard to their ability to
					cross the plasma membrane. The first category is
							nonpolar molecules. These hydrophobic
							molecules can easily cross the membrane because they
					interact favorably with the nonpolar lipids. Note that these molecules can
					accumulate in the membrane because they interact so well with the
							lipids. The second category is small
							polar molecules. Although they donâ€™t interact with the
					lipids, their small size allows them to pass through small temporary holes in
					the membrane. The third category is large polar molecules.
					These have difficulty crossing the membrane because of their size and poor
					interaction with the lipids. The last category is ionic
							compounds. Their charge interacts very unfavorably with the
					lipids, making it very difficult for them to cross the membrane.
