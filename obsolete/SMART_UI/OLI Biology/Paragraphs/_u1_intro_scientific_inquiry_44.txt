However, imagine if the same study were done with 10,000 women, and the infection rates were
					2,000 of 5,000 in the control group and zero of 5,000 in the experimental group.
					Random events would be spread out among a very large group of people in this
					study; on average, the two big groups should have similar sexual behavior and
					other factors influencing infection rates. If there is a big difference at the
					end of the study, it is very unlikely that this result
					occurred by random chance.
