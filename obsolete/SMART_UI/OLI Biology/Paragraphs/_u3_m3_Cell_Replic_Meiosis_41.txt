Aneuploidy is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes in
					a cell. It is caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when
					chromosomes fail to separate properly during anaphase.  Genetic problems caused
					by nondisjunction can be diagnosed prenatally by studying the fetusâ€™
							karyotype. A karyotype is a visual representation
					of the chromosomes of an individual, obtained from a small sample of cells. In
					fetuses, this is usually obtained from sampling either the amniotic liquid
					(amniocentesis) or the placenta.
