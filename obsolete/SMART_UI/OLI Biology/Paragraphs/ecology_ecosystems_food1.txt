Energy and nutrients take many complicated paths through an ecosystem. Feeding
			relationships are a good place to start; they describe how atoms and calories move
			through the living community. Take as an example the simple act of eating a tomato. A
			tomato plant grows and produces fruit only if it has plenty of light and nutrients.
			Chemical energy is stored in the bonds that join together the tomatoâ€™s organic
			molecules. After you eat and digest a tomato, some of its molecules are broken down into
			their subunits. Your cells can use some of that energy to make new molecules or run
			processes in your cells. Much of it is released as heat.
