Combining all of these roles together, the Central Dogma of modern molecular biology follows
      the process outlined in this section and depicted below. DNA, with the aid of specific
      proteins and enzymes is replicated (DNA Replication) thus providing a copy to be passed to the
      next generation, the DNA is transcribed in sections (Transcription) into a RNA molecule that
      codes for a protein or that can itself be used in the form of RNA, and the RNA can be
      translated (Translation) into the primary sequence of a protein.
