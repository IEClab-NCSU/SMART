Increased intensity or duration of drought. Climate change
                    is likely to reduce rainfall in some regions. Even if rainfall does not decline,
                    warmer temperatures lead directly to drier soils and lower water levels by
                    speeding up evaporation and boosting the rate at which plants use water.
                    Record-breaking droughts and wildfire seasons are some indicators that this
                    effect is already under way in some regions. Droughts threaten human well-being
                    by limiting crop production and by reducing the availability of water for
                    municipal use, navigation, power generation, and recreation.
