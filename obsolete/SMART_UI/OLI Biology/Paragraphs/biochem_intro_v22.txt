To make sense of how cells work, we must constantly return to their parts (atoms and
			molecules) and the interactions among them. You will learn, later in this unit, that
			atoms are the fundamental unit of matter, and that 92 different types of atoms (called
			elements) occur naturally on earth. Biological systems use only a small subset of the
			elements (approximately 10 %) found on earth. By learning about the characteristics of
			this subset of atoms, and a limited set of functional groups found in biological
			molecules, you will be able to identify, and predict many of the reactions that can take
			place in cells, understand and predict the physical properties of the molecules made by
			these reactions, and develop an understanding of why a process occurs as it does in a
			cell.
