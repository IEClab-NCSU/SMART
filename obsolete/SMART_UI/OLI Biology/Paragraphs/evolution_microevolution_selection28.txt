Artificial selection is sometimes referred to as selective breeding. It has been
					in use for thousands of years as humans have domesticated plants and animals to
					suit their needs. As we discussed at the beginning of this module, corn as we
					know it today (with large, full ears) has been selectively bred by humans from
					its wild grass ancestor (with small, sparse ears). In the same way, dairy cows
					have been selectively bred to produce more milk; beef cattle have been bred to
					have more muscle; horses have been bred to run faster; tomatoes have been bred
					to produce larger fruit; and wild mustard has been bred to produce cabbage,
					Brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and kohlrabi.
