Instructions: The left panel shows the energy changes that occur
            for each of the ten steps in glycolysis in the absence of coupling. The right
            panel shows the actual energy changes during the normal operation of glycolysis. These
            energy changes include contributions from both direct and indirect coupling. Click 
              on any of the red labeled steps on the left to see the details of that step in the 
              glycolysis pathway.
