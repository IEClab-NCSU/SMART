Obesity may result from a mismatch between our evolutionary adaptations and the realities of
					the modern world. We expend less calories each day on physical tasks than did
					previous generations of humans. More than 100 years ago, the average person may
					have expended 30 percent to 50 percent more calories each day than a typical
					modern American. In addition, today we have continuous access to an
					unprecedented array of calorie-rich foods. In times past, when food was scarce
					and could not be preserved easily, it was adaptive to feast on rich foods when
					they were available. Those who did so could build up fat and glycogen reserves,
					and thus were more likely to survive famines. Today, in a changed environment,
					the same behaviors predispose us to obesity.
