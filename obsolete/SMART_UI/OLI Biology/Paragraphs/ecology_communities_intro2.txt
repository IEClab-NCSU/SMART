Scientists learn about species interactions first by direct observation. For example, it
			is simple enough to discover a predator-prey relationship by watching a lion take down
			an antelope, or by finding prey in a predatorâ€™s stomach. However, community ecologists
			often want to go a step further and determine the consequences
			of an interaction. How will a community change if a new species is added, or if an
			existing population dies out? To find out, ecologists may do comparative observations or
			experiments, as we will see in this module.
