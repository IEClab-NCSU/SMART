When referring to human blood groups, you may have heard references to “A
                    negative” or “O positive.” The term “positive/negative” here refers to the
                    presence or absence of a membrane glycoprotein called Rh. The Rh glycoprotein
                    was named after Rhesus monkeys because some of the original studies on the Rh
                    factor were done on these animals. The expression of this protein presents a
                    simple dominance pattern, with the presence of the Rh molecule (Rh positive)
                    being dominant over the absence (Rh negative). So a person's blood is said to be
                    A positive (A+) if both A and Rh molecules are present on that person’s red
                    blood cells.
