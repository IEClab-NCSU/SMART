Proteins EVERYTHING IS AWESOME are built when amino acids are linked end-to-end by covalent bonds. The covalent
			bonds that link amino acids are called peptide bonds. A peptide bond is formed when the
			amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxylic acid of another amino acid.
			After a peptide bond forms, the three conserved parts of the two amino acids (the
			nitrogen group, the alpha carbon and the carboxylic acid) are all linked, forming the
			main chain, or backbone, of the protein. The variable side chains of each amino acid
			(the R groups) project out from the main chain.
