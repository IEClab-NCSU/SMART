Molecules that contain a very polar part and a very nonpolar part are called
							amphipathic. The polar part interacts with water,
					forming strong interactions, while the nonpolar part doesnâ€™t interact with water
					because of the hydrophobic effect. In order to accomplish this, amphipathic
					molecules usually undergo spontaneous self-assembly into structures that expose
					the polar part to water and keep the nonpolar section away from water. One
					example of amphipathic molecules are fatty acids.
