Diagrammatic representation of an organism's genome. An image of the
                                chromosomes of a cell in metaphase where the chromosomes are
                                arranged in pairs by centromere position and size. Karyotypes are
                                used to count and analyze the chromosomes of an individual and can
                                also be used in the determination of chromosomal abnormalities.
