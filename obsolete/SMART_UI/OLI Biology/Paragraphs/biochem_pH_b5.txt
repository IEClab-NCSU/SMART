If you ever come into contact with a strong acid or base and receive a chemical
					burn, DO NOT attempt your own science experiment to try and neutralize the
					compound. The damage to your skin is already occurring and can be exacerbated by
					adding more chemicals; a vigorous neutralization reaction could cause further
					harm through the release of heat, causing a physical burn on top of the chemical
					burn already suffered. Your safest option is to wash the affected area under a
					heavy stream of running water, and to seek medical attention for your burn. The
					goal is to remove the agent causing the burn to prevent further damage.
