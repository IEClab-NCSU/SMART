 Thus the non-covalent bonds that have been introduced have approximately 20
					times less energy associated with them and, thus, are more easily broken
					individually. However, hydrogen bonds generally form extensive networks, and the
					total energy associated with the network is the sum of the individual
					interactions. As anyone who has done a "belly buster" knows, breaking a large
					surface area of water is extremely difficult (and painful!).
