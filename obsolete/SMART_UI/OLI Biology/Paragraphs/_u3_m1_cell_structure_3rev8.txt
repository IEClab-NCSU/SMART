Most organelles, including ribosomes (after they
							are built in the nucleus), are found in the
								cytoplasm, which is the substance found
							between the nucleus and the cell membrane (number eight in the cell
							factory diagram). The cytoplasm is analogous to the factory floor, where
							all the work takes place.
