There are some easily observable human traits that follow the Mendelian inheritance
            pattern, showing a dominant and a recessive allele. Examples include unattached earlobes
            (dominant) versus attached earlobes (recessive). The widow’s peak hairline, a cleft
            chin, rolling tongue, and hitchhiker’s thumb are others. Does the ability to roll your
            tongue make you more fit for survival? Not really! One common misconception is that
            dominant traits are more favorable from an evolutionary point of view. Another is that
            dominant traits are more common. We cannot stress enough that traits, and particularly
            human traits, are determined by complex interactions between genes and environment. In
            the early days of genetics, simple observable traits were used to describe inheritance
            patterns. Once the molecular basis of inheritance was established, scientists could
            tackle more complex interactions. You will learn more about this in the Molecular Genetics unit.
