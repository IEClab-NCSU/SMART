Are all wavelengths of light equally useful for photosynthesis? In 1883, a scientist
			named George Engelmann designed an experiment to answer this question. He shined a light
			through a prism to separate the different wavelengths so that they landed on different
			zones along the length of filaments of Spirogyra, a type of
			green algae. Examine the following image depicting Engelmannâ€™s results.
