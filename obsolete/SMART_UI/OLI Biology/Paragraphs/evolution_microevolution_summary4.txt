While all of these mechanisms of microevolution have been discussed as separate
                    entities, it is important to remember that all of these mechanisms are working
                    in concert. As you have seen, understanding the mechanisms of evolution can not
                    only help us to grow better produce or breed better dogs, but it also helps us
                    develop strategies to combat infectious diseases that take their toll on human
                    lives. Evolution is one of the driving forces in the world today and is one of
                    scienceâ€™s most important Theories.
