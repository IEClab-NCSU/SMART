The electron is the reactive part of the atom. The number and location of
					electrons determines the interactions between atoms. As you recall, negatively
					charged electrons are pulled toward the positively charged nucleus. But
					electrons are kept in orbit by kinetic energy. Electrons that are close to the
					nucleus are less energetic than those electrons farther from the nucleus.
