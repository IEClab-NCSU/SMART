 Both DNA and RNA are linear polymers. The components of the backbone of the polymer
          include a set of furanose 
          sugars linked together by bridging phosphate molecules in a synthesis between
          the 3 position of one furanose and the 5 position of the next furanose. This linkage is
          made through condensation synthesis formation of ester bonds by a bridging phosphate
          molecule between two hydroxyl groups, one on each furanose ring. The resulting polymer is
          a string of furanose molecules linked by phosphodiester bonds and having the 5 position
          exposed on one end of the polymer and the 3 position exposed on the other end of the
          molecule.
