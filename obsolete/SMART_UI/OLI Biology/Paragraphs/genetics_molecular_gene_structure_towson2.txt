In this module, we will focus on the structure of the protein-coding genes. A
            protein-coding gene contains information for making the mRNA that is translated into a
            protein. First, letâ€™s consider what kind of information in the mRNA is required to
            produce a protein during translation, and then we will step back and look at the
            information in the gene that is required for transcription.
