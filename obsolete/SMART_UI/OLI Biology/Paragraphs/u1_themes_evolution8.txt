In a science classroom we should focus on the direct evidence for
            evolution that we can observe in fossils and in organisms that are alive today. In
            fact, American public school teachers are legally required to teach about evolution
            from a scientific perspective and to refrain from teaching a particular religious
            account as if it were science. Does that mean science is at war with religion? No.
            Evolutionary biologists are thoughtful individuals and have different ways they deal
            with the “big questions” of life and meaning. Some are religious, some are not. But
            they are unified in their appreciation for the power of evolutionary theory to
            explain and predict life’s observable and verifiable features.
