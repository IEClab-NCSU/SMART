If you look at people around you, you will probably notice a fairly large variation in
            height. Some people are taller than you, while others are shorter than you. Consider
            this trait as an example that you want to understand on the molecular level. What kinds
            of molecules may be involved in determining a personâ€™s height? If you and your parents
            are relatively short (or tall), you may say that you inherited the short (or tall)
            stature from your parents. What molecule is involved in the
            transmission of information from one generation to the next? DNA. How does information
            contained in DNA affect your height? One possible explanation is that your DNA contains a gene
            encoding a protein called growth hormone. This protein is produced by the pituitary
            gland, travels to other tissues, and delivers a signal for the cells to grow and divide.
            Changes in the amount of protein produced or the sequence of amino acids in
            the protein can affect the function. If bone and muscle cells receive only a small
            number of signal molecules, the person will end up with a short stature. If they receive
            a large number of signal molecules, the person may end up being very tall. For a
            signaling protein (hormone) to deliver the signal, there must be a protein that can bind
            the hormone and receive the signal (receptor protein). The variation in height will
            result from any of the following:
