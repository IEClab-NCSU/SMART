In our exploration of biology, you have learned that matter is organized into
			hierarchical levels starting with non-living entities (atoms and
				subatomic particles) to the cell (the first level of
				life) to complex organisms (plants and animals) to the
			biosphere. In the previous unit, “Introduction to Chemistry,” you learned that atoms can combine to form molecules. In this unit, we’ll
			take a closer look at a special group of molecules: the biological macromolecules. Like
			all organic molecules, biological macromolecules contain hydrogen atoms that form
			covalent bonds with carbon atoms. There are four significant classes of biological
			macromolecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. These macromolecules
			are the building blocks that are used to form the cell, which is the fundamental unit of
			life.
