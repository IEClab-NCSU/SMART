Thus far, we have been exploring how subtle changes can occur within a population. Weâ€™ve
            seen that these changes can lead to adaptation. The genetic makeup of populations also
            can change through migration and interbreeding (gene flow) and even through the vagaries
            of chance (genetic drift). But how does this relate to macroevolution? For example, can
            microevolution possibly explain the origin of new and different species?
