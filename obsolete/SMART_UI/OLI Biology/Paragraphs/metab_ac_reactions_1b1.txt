 Living organisms consume food, in the form of carbohydrates, fats, and amino
					acids, to live. The process of metabolism breaks these
					complex biomolecules into simple molecules with the release of energy. The most
					common form of energy is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This
					high energy phosphorylated compound is used as a energy source in many cellular
					processes and for bio-mechanical functions, such as muscle contraction or ion
					transport across membranes. The resultant compounds and energy released from
					food are used to synthesize complex molecules for the specialized needs of the
					cell or organism.
