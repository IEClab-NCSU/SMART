As discussed at the beginning of this unit, modern molecular biology has developed a Central
      Dogma that describes a series of processes starting with DNA and ending with the production of
      a protein using the genetic code. This Central Dogma is diagrammed in the figure below. The
      initiation of this process is DNA Replication, highlighted in red, which describes the copying
      of the information existing in DNA to new DNA. One of the most important processes that a cell
      performs before it can divide is to faithfully replicate its chromosome. While there are
      differences between prokaryotes
      and eukaryotes, there are great similarities in the mechanism by which they replicate their DNA.
      This unit will describe this mechanism of DNA replication
