Epimers: Monosaccharides that differ by chirality at one position (besides the anomeric carbon) are called epimers.  For example, glucose and galactose are epimers of each other.   Galactose  is one of the monosaccharides that make up lactose, or milk sugar. There are enzyme catalysts capable of inter-converting galactose to glucose by inverting the chiral center.  Thus the galactose that is released from lactose can be concerted to glucose and used for energy.
