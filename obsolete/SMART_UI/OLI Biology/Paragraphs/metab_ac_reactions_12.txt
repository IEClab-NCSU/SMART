Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are the most common metabolic pathways. Together
			they form a cycle comprising the general flow of energy through the biosphere. Sunlight provides the
			essential source of energy. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms capture this
			energy, and through a chemical reaction with carbon dioxide and water, the photosynthesis
			process converts the light energy to chemical energy, and produces glucose and oxygen.
			Organisms ingest the glucose and oxygen, and through the process of cellular respiration
(i.e., aerobic respiration), break down these large molecules producing carbon dioxide
			and water. The outputs of cellular respiration then become the raw materials for
			photosynthesis.
