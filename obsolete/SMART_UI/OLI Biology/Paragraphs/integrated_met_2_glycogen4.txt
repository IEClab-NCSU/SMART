For storage, glucose is added to the free 4-hydroxyl groups of the glycogen molecule,
      elongating the linear chains. Since the release of glucose by phosphorolysis is spontaneous,
      the direct addition of glucose to glycogen must be energetically unfavorable. Consequently,
      the synthetic reaction requires coupling to an energy releasing reaction to become
      spontaneous. The addition of glucose to glycogen proceeds in two steps. First,
      glucose-1-phosphate reacts with UTP to produces a high energy intermediate, UDP-glucose, which
      in turn is used by the enzyme glycogen synthase to add glucose to glycogen.
