Over longer time periods, body fat is used to store excess energy. When glycogen stores are
			full, the body switches over to storing the excess energy as fat. Remember that energy
			is stored within chemical bonds, and so it is the chemical bonds within glycogen and fat
			molecules that contain energy. Fat is an efficient way for the body to store extra
			calories, because it is able to pack more calories per unit mass when compared with
			carbohydrates or proteins (see Figure 8.2 below). You can think of body fat as a
			long-term, highly compacted energy reserve.
