Viruses contain genetic information in the form of either DNA or RNA. The genetic
			information is surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. Some viruses also have a
			membrane structure surrounding their genetic information. Viruses are tiny particles and
			they lack the machinery necessary for growth and reproduction. In order to reproduce, a
			virus must infect a host cell and hijack the host cellâ€™s machinery. In other words, a
			virus cannot reproduce without using the tools of another cell.
