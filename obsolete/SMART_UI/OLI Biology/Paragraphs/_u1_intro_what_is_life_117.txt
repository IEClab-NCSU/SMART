Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was serendipitously discovered by Alexander
					Fleming in 1928. He had left some Petri dishes out too long and mold had grown
					on the bacterial medium. Looking closely, Fleming saw that bacteria did not grow
					well in a zone around the moldy spots. Following up on a hunch, he deliberately
					added mold to some plates seeded with bacteria and found that bacteria were
					killed near the mold colonies. By the mid-1940s, just in time to help wounded
					soldiers in World War II, scientists were able to mass-produce a drug derived
					from the mold.
