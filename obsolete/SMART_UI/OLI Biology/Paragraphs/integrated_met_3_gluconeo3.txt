Since the process of converting glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis is energy releasing,
          the reverse reaction must require energy. Most of the steps in the gluconeogenesis pathway
          have a Gibbs free energy of nearly zero, and are easily reversed by slight changes in the
          concentrations of products and reactions. However, there are three steps in glycolysis
          that occur with such a large decrease in energy that they cannot become spontaneous in the
          reverse direction. These steps are:
