The Golgi apparatus is the packaging and shipping
							center of the cell, where the proteins that were built by the
									ER assembly line are delivered to
							different parts of the cell, or in multicellular organisms, to different
							parts of the body. Often the Golgi apparatus packages proteins in
									vesicles and
								vacuoles, which are membrane-bound sacs that
							function in storage and transport. Vesicles are specialized for
							transport and some other functions. Their membranes can fuse with the
							plasma membrane, allowing them to empty their contents into the
							extracellular space. Vesicles also may fuse with the membranes of the
							endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, allowing them to empty their
							contents into those organelles. Lysosomes are
							specialized vesicles found only in animal cells. Lysosomes contain
							powerful digestive enzymes that can recycle cellular parts or destroy
							external invaders. Vacuoles are specialized mainly for storage. Their
							membranes do not fuse with the membranes of other cellular
							components.
