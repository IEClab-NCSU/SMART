Carboxyl:Charged at neutral pH, with a charge of -1. At low pH
						values, this group is protonated and becomes neutral.
Amino:Also charged at neutral pH, with a charge of +1. At high pH
						values, this group is deprotonated and becomes neutral.
Phosphate:Typically has two negative charges at neutral pH. A
						special case of a phosphate group is a phosphate diester, which links
						together nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The phosphate diester is always
						negatively charged at neutral pH.
