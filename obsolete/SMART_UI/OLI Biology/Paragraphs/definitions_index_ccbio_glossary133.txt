One of the two types of molecules that combine to form triglycerides
                                (fats and oils). Fatty acids are unbranched hydrocarbons that
                                terminate with a single carboxyl functional group. The fatty acids
                                are generally 16-22 carbons long and can be both saturated and
                                unsaturated.
