 We have come to the end of this Unit, but evolution continues and our understanding of
            this process continues to grow. In particular, modern DNA sequencing technology has
            given us unprecedented access to the genomes of a growing host of species. In these data
            we find what Sean Carroll, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, has called the
            “ultimate forensic record of evolution.”
