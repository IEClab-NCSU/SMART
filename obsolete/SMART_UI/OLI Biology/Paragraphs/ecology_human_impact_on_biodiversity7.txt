As a whole, biodiversity may seem limitless. But when we look at specific
                    communities and species, we can see evidence to the contrary. Biodiversity is
                    reduced when populations are eliminated from local communities (local
                    extinction). Local extinctions can severely disrupt ecological communities and
                    may even lead to additional extinctions. This is particularly likely if keystone
                    species are lost, as you learned in the community ecology module. Over time,
                    local extinctions can lead to the loss of an entire species when the last
                    reproducing group dies out (global extinction). Global extinction is
                    irreversible: When a species goes extinct, we lose all future opportunities to
                    learn from it, use it, and appreciate it.
