Clearly, greenhouse gases are increasing. And you already know that human
                    population and impact have increased greatly through the Industrial Age, so it
                    is natural to suspect that human activities are the cause of recent changes in
                    atmospheric gases. Many lines of evidence confirm this. Specific human
                    activities and practices are known to emit greenhouse gases and are also known
                    to have increased in step with rising greenhouse gas concentrations.
