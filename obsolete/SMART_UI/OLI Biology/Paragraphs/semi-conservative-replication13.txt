More than one DNA polymerase enzyme is known and each carries out a specific function
          depending on the situation. For example, DNA polymerase III is the enzyme used in
          replicating a genome while DNA polymerase I is used in DNA repair. Even with clear
          differences as to when each of the DNA polymerases is used during the replication of DNA,
          the basic substrate requirements are the same.
