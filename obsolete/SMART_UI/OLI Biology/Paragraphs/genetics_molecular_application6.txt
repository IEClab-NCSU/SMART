In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, Czar Nicholas II and his entire family
                were reportedly executed by the communists. It was rumored at the time that two of
                the Czarâ€™s children, Anastasia and Alexei, escaped and survived. Later examination
                of the gravesite showed that two bodies were indeed missing, suggesting that the
                rumor was true. A woman living in Germany, Ann, claimed that she was Anastasia. DNA
                was obtained both from this woman and from a preserved blood sample belonging to the
                Czar (from a bloodstained shirt left over from an assassination attempt in Japan).
                PCR was used to amplify tandem repeats in two regions of the chromosome for both DNA
                samples, and the results are shown on the following gel.
