The second major idea of evolution is that of natural selection. Natural selection helps
                    explain how groups of organisms become well-suited, or adapted, to their
                    surroundings. Individuals are always a bit different from their parents and from
                    each other, partly because of changes to their genes. These differences may be
                    helpful or harmful to the individuals that inherit them. In nature, individuals
                    often have very low odds of surviving to reproduce. Individuals with slightly
                    harmful or even average characteristics might be less likely to make it, and
                    those with traits that fit in very well with the local habitat will have the
                    greatest chance to survive and reproduce. This sorting process goes on
                    generation after generation. Each time only a tiny fraction of those born are
                    well-suited and lucky enough to pass their genes along; the others die, leaving
                    no descendants. As generations of time pass, inherited features that help
                    organisms produce offspring become more common within a population. Harmful
                    features that reduce reproduction become less common. Many experiments have
                    demonstrated the effects of natural selection on populations in the laboratory
                    and in nature. The process of natural selection is one way that scientists have
                    explained the vast diversity of life on our planet.
