Glycolysis is the first pathway that occurs in the metabolism of carbohydrates. This
          pathway occurs in the cytosol of all cells, i.e. it is a highly conserved and ubiquitous
          pathway. Although many different disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides and
          enter the glycolysis, we will focus on how glucose is metabolized in this section. The
          entry points of other sugars will be discussed in the module on integrated
          metabolism.
