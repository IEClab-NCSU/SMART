As you remember from the Meiosis 
            module, of the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in a human
            somatic cell, 22 are autosomes, and the 23rd pair are sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes
            are of two types: X and Y. Males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), and females have
            two copies of the X chromosome (XX). If the gene responsible for the disorder is present
            on the autosomes, it is called an autosomal disorder. The term “autosomal” refers to
            chromosomes that are not sex determining. On the other hand, if the responsible gene is
            present on a sex chromosome, it is called a sex-linked disorder. Due to the fact that
            the male Y chromosome is very small and contains only genes related to sex
            determination, sex-linked disorders are due to defective alleles on the X chromosome.
            The following table shows the inheritance patterns of some human genetic disorders and
            abnormalities.
