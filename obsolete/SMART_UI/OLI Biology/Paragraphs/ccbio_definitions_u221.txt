 Chemical bonds that form molecules and are a result of sharing of electrons;
                        electrons can be shared equally (non-polar covalent) or unequally (polar
                            covalent). In the diagram below that illustrates the formation of a methane
                        molecule, the carbon atom shares each of its 4 valence electrons with one
                        hydrogen atom, which in turn shares its 1 valence electron with the carbon
                        atom.
