In 1853, Mendel left the monastery for two years to study at the University of
                    Vienna, where he learned about mathematics and botany. When he returned to the
                    monastery, he began investigating how plants passed on their characteristics to
                    their offspring. He was conducting this research only a few years before Charles
                    Darwin published On the Origin of Species.
