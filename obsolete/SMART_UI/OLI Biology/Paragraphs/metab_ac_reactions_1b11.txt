Photosynthesis is an anabolic process youâ€™ll learn more about in
					this unit. Protein synthesis is an amazing feat of anabolism.
					Protein chains (polypeptides) are produced by linking together relatively simple
					amino acid monomers. In one polypeptide, thousands of amino acids may be strung
					together, and several different polypeptides may fold and bind to each other to
					form a large and complex protein molecule.
