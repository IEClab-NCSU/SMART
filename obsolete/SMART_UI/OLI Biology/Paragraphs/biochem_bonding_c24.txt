Molecules can be much more complex than methane. Carbon can form long chains
						as each carbon forms covalent bonds with multiple other carbons. When
						drawing molecules, it is important to make sure that each atom has a full
						outer shell. In the case of carbon, this simply means that carbon will form
						four covalent bonds.
