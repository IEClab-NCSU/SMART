You might wonder how a species and a population are different from one another.
			Populations are subsets of a species. The dandelions in Boston, Massachusetts and those
			in Annapolis, Maryland belong to separate populations. They are not likely to breed with
			one another because their pollen doesn't travel that far. However, the Boston dandelions
			and the Annapolis dandelions do belong to the same species. They could breed with one another if conditions allowed. For example, breeding
			could occur if a human being carried dandelion pollen from Boston to Annapolis.
