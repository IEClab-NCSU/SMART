To make sense of how cells work, you must constantly return to their parts (atoms and
			molecules) and the interactions among them. This is why a clear understanding of some
			chemistry is essential to understanding how life functions. This unit will focus on the
			atom. You will learn how atoms combine to form different molecules, making up all the
			diverse matter you see around you. In this unit, you will explore only nonliving
			components of the hierarchy of life.
