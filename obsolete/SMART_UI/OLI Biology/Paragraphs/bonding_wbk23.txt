Ionic bonds form between oppositely charged atoms. No electron sharing or
					transfer occurs. The atoms are attracted to each other due to their opposite
					charges. For example, the positive Na ion, and negatively charged Cl ion, are
					attracted to each other and form table salt. In an aqueous solution, these ions
					are completely dissociated and are defined as strong electrolytes. In water
					molecules surround the ions to form polar interactions to satisfy the charges on
					the ions. Thus the ions become encapsulated by water spheres, which are called
						spheres of hydration. The biological world is very ionic and the
					spheres of hydration are important in a cell because they maintain the
					separation of the many ions of the cell from each other. The sphere of hydration
					must be broken in order for binding to take place with a specific binding
					partner.
