The activity below deals with a mutation in the gene that encodes the oxygen transport
			protein hemoglobin. The mutation causes hemoglobin to form long rods inside red blood
			cells. As a result, it is difficult for the cells to pass through blood vessels. This
			leads to a disease called sickle cell anemia in many of those who inherit the
			mutation.
