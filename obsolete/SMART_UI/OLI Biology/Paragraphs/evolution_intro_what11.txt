Heritable variation exists in a population. In other words, the population
                includes different genetic types that can pass on their characteristics to their
                offspring. These types exist because of past mutations. In the example above, the
                “bleached” form of lizard has a known mutation in a pigmentation gene called Mc1r.
                Mutations in the same gene influence coloration in a wide range of animals including
                fish, falcons, mice, dogs, and humans.
Selection occurs: some of the genetic types reproduce more than others in a
                given environment. In the lizard example, imagine a time when most lizards in the
                White Sands area had a darker color form. A new “bleached” mutant appeared in the
                population. On the white background, “bleached” lizards probably survived much
                better than did those who inherited a darker color pattern. Experiments have
                confirmed that small animals that match their backgrounds are much less likely to be
                attacked by visual predators. A matching color pattern is an adaptive trait: it
                results in improved average reproductive success in the appropriate
                environment.
Adaptation results: over generations of time, those genetic types that
                reproduce more successfully become more common in a population. Adaptive traits
                become common as a result of past and ongoing natural selection. In the core of the
                White Sands area, the vast majority of lizards show the “bleached” color
                pattern.
