Heat is the energy possessed by any substance because of the random jiggling of
					its molecules and atoms. It is a low form of energy, disorderly, and spreads out
					rapidly through most materials. Every kind of energy conversion generates at
					least some heat energy as a byproduct. For example, the breakdown and use of
					chemical energy in food also releases heat. Heat can be helpful in keeping our
					bodies warm, but for the most part heat energy is a loss: an energy waste that
					cannot be recovered. No organism can capture heat and use it to do work or to
					make food. Instead, heat seeps out of organisms and eventually into space,
					leaving the biosphere forever.
