 In Molecular Genetics, first you will learn about the storage, transmission,
            and expression of genetic information (central dogma of molecular
                    biology), whereby the information content in
                DNA sequences, called genes, is
            ultimately converted to a protein. Then you will look at the structure of genes and
            genomes and at the interactions between genes and the environment. Finally, you will
            examine how humans are able to manipulate genes through
                biotechnology.
