The general idea is that a population is like a bank account. Every so often, we can
			remove the interest that has accumulated in a bank account. This
			can continue indefinitely so long as we do not remove any of the principal that is earning the interest. Similarly, every so often we can
			remove a populationâ€™s growth without causing the population to
			decline: it will be reset to its beginning level and the harvested individuals will be
			replaced by further reproduction and growth. Ideally, we should be able to find the
			population size that provide the maximum level of growth (and harvest) each year.
			Population modeling can help with this effort.
