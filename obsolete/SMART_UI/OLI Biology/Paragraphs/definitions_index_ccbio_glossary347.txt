A type of lipid (also known as fats and oils) used to store energy
                                long term. Fats are synthesized from two different classes of
                                molecules: fatty acids and alcohol. Fats and oils have three long
                                carbon chains attached to glycerol (a short carbon chain). There are
                                many different triglyceriders; some are highly saturated and some
                                are unsaturated.
