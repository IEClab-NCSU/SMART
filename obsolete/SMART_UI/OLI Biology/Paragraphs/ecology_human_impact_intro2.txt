Today, however, ecologists recognize that humans have an influence on all
            communities and ecosystems. In some ways, we are simply participants in and
            members of ecosystems. Like other animals, we feed on the bodies of plants and
            other animals; excrete gaseous, liquid, and solid wastes; and disturb small
            areas of soil when we travel across the landscape on foot. In most of our
            activities, however, humans have impacts that go far beyond those of other
            animal species. What makes us different?
