A cell that is 2N = 6 has 6 total chromosomes. This cell is diploid (2N) because it
				has two sets of chromosomes. Each parent would have given this cell three
				chromosomes â€” one parent donating the chromosomes seen in the top row, the other
				donating the chromosomes seen in the bottom row.
