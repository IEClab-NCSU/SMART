 Food and water are prevented from entering the airway when we swallow by a structure
                    called the epiglottis. It is not uncommon for organs to be part of more than one
                    organ system. The pancreas, for example, has both digestive and endocrine
                    functions, and the kidneys play a role in both the urinary and endocrine
                    systems.
