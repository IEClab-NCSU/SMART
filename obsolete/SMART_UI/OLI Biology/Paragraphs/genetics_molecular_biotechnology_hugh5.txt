A synthetic gene is made that can be translated into the amino acid sequence of the
                human growth hormone.
This gene is inserted in the correct location in a closed circular piece of DNA (an
                expression plasmid) by use of restriction sites.
The expression plasmid is introduced into bacteria.
The bacteria are grown to a high cell density, and then lactose is added to induce
                the production of human growth hormone.
