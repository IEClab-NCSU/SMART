All detergents are amphipathic molecules; they have a polar, water-loving (hydrophilic) part and a
			nonpolar, water-hating (hydrophobic) part, which allows them to dissolve in both water and oils. The
			chemical structure of a common detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), is shown below.
			The hydrophilic part of SDS interacts favorably with water by hydrogen bonding and
			electrostatic (charge-charge) interactions between the negative charge on the SDS and
			the partial positive charges on the polar water molecules. The hydrophobic part has no
			polar atoms to form favorable interactions with the water.
