Meiosis is divided into two phases. In meiosis I, homologous pairs of chromosomes
					bind together and exchange pieces. This process is called "crossing over" and is
					essential for generating diversity within a species. By the end of meiosis I the
					homologous pairs of chromosomes have been sorted into separate cells. In meiosis
					II, the individual chromatids of a chromosome are sorted into separate cells. By
					the end of meiosis, a single diploid cell has divided into four haploid
					cells.
