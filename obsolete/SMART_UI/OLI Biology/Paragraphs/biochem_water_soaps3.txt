When placed in water, detergents spontaneously form organized spherical structures called
				micelles. In a micelle, the hydrophilic part of the detergent is on the
			surface of the sphere and interacts with the water. The center of the sphere contains
			the hydrophobic part of the detergent, hidden from the water. A cross section image and
			a three-dimensional structure of a micelle are shown below. When a micelle comes in
			contact with oily (hydrophobic) compounds, the oils dissolve into the interior of the
			micelle and can be washed away with the micelle.
