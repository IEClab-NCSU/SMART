The enzymes for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan are contained
                            in the Trp operon. The structure of this operon is shown below. The trp
                            repressor binds the amino acid tryptophan, the end product of the
                            biosynthesis of tryptophan (trp). As you can see, it has the same
                            structure as the lac operon, but it contains more genes for the
                            biosynthesis of trp.
