Both placebo treatments and double-blind procedures are designed to prevent bias. Bias is any
			systematic error that makes a particular experimental outcome more or less likely.
			Errors can happen in any experiment: people make mistakes in measurement, instruments
			fail, computer glitches can alter data. But most such errors are random and don’t favor
			one outcome over another. Patients’ belief in a treatment can make it more likely to
			appear to “work.” Placebos and double-blind procedures are used to level the playing
			field so that both groups of study subjects are treated equally and share similar
			beliefs about their treatment.
