Land plants also face the risk of drying out. Plants have evolved traits that protect
			their above-ground portions from excess water loss. For example, plant leaves are sealed
			with a layer of waxy material called cuticle. Protected in this way, leaves cannot
			efficiently absorb water when it rains. Instead, land plants absorb water from the
			ground (through their roots).
