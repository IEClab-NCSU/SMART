A water molecule attracts four other water molecules towards it: one each to the two free 
			pairs of electrons in the valence shell, and one each to the hydrogens covalently bonded 
			to the oxygen. As the water molecules associate with each other they have a defined structure 
			dictated by the tetrahydral geometry

 of the electrons around the oxygen atom as seen in the Jmol image below. 
			The partially positive hydrogens associate with the free electron pairs from other water 
			molecules, while the partially negative charge on the oxygen's free electron pairs 
			associate with the partially positive hydrogens from another water molecule. Use the 3-D 
			JMOL image below to examine the structure of an ice crystal and observe the orientation of 
			water molecules in the crystal.
