The cell membranes found in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells
			consist of a phospholipid bilayer that separates
			the internal environment of the cell from its external environment and regulates the
			materials that pass in and out of the cell. This enables the cell to maintain internal
				homeostasis, regardless of changing external conditions. You already know
			that cell membranes can be structurally different, to enable different functions. For
			example, some bacteria live in the frozen Arctic Circle. They are able to maintain
			membrane fluidity because of an increased concentration of unsaturated fatty acid tails
			found within the membrane phospholipids.
