Reproduction occurs when an individual organism passes on its genetic information to a
            newly independent organism, or offspring. Individual organisms have a limited life span.
            All are subject to extreme events that bring death, such as being eaten by a predator.
            Even if they avoid such a fate, most organisms decline in health and die toward the end
            of their typical life span. Reproduction maintains genetic information by passing it to
            new individuals. Offspring resemble their parent(s) and reproduction maintains the
            continuity of life over time.
