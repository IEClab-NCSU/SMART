Genetic drift often reduces the diversity of a gene pool and has the biggest effect when
			there is a low number of organisms in the population. In two different situations,
			genetic drift can profoundly affect a gene pool. The first is known as the bottleneck effect. When events like fires, earthquakes,
			hurricanes, and other disasters kill a large percent of the population, the surviving
			population is unlikely to have the same gene pool as the original population. It is very
			likely that some alleles will be underrepresented or overrepresented in the surviving
			population as compared to the original. An analogy may help. Half the cards in a deck
			are red (hearts and diamonds) and the other half are black (spades and clubs). But if
			you draw six cards from the deck at random, will you always get 3 red and 3 black cards?
			No. You might well draw six black or six red cards. Similarly, consider a grove of 1000
			oak trees. If a flash flood washes away and kills 900 of the trees, the alleles of these
			trees have been lost from the population gene pool. Compared to the original group, the
			100 lucky survivors will have higher percentages of some genetic types, a lower
			percentage of others, and some alleles might be entirely missing. The flood altered the
			populationâ€™s gene pool in a random way.
