A carbohydrate is an organic molecule that contains carbon,
			hydrogen, and oxygen. Carbohydrates are either simple (often referred to as sugars) or
			complex. Simple carbohydrates (sugars) are made up of only one or two sugar monomers.
			Each monomer has the proportion of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen in the
			ratio of 1:2:1, or CH2O). You can see why these compounds are called
			carbohydrates; in a monomer, each carbon is “hydrated.” Complex carbohydrates are made
			up of more than two sugar monomers linked together. Carbohydrates can be further
			subclassified, again on the basis of structure, depending on the number of monomers in
			each molecule: monosaccharides and disaccharides (simple
			carbohydrates) and polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates).
