Atoms of
					different elements have many different features, including different sizes and
					levels of reactivity. For example, sodium is an incredibly reactive element,
					especially when it combines with water. Lead, on the other hand, is relatively
					inert. Yet all elements share some regular patterns that make it easier for us to
					categorize them and understand why they behave as they do.
