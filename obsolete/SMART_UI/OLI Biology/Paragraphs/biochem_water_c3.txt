These cohesive forces are related to water’s property of adhesion, or the
			attraction between water molecules and other molecules. This is observed when water
			“climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will notice that the water appears
			to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water
			molecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it.
