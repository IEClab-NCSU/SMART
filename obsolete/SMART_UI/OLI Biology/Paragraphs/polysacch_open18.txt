 Many other hetero-polysaccharides exist to carryout a variety of functions within an
			organism. A unique hetero-polysaccharide produced by bacteria is the peptido-glycan that
			forms the basic structure of the bacterial cell wall. In this case there is a linear
			hetero-polysaccharide that acts much like the linear strands of cellulose in the plant
			cell wall. However, as implied by the name, the peptido-glycan is a covalent complex
			between a polysaccharide (glycan) and a peptide (a fragment of a protein). In the
			bacterial peptido-glycan, the linear hetero-polysaccharide chains are linked together by
			covalent bonds using a peptide as the linker. As seen in the illustration below, this
			means that the bacterial cell wall is fully connected by covalent bonds while the plant
			cell wall is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups on parallel strands.
