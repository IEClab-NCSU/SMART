Community ecology focuses on the populations that live and interact with each other in an
            area. Species can interact directly in ways that are mutually positive (mutualism),
            negative for both species (competition), or helpful to one species and harmful to the
            other (predation). Symbiosis occurs whenever two species live in close physical contact
            with each other. Species may also interact indirectly through third parties. Certain
            species play particularly important roles in communities. Foundation species provide
            food and habitat structure to many other species. Keystone species are important despite
            their low abundance. Many of them are predators; they control prey populations that
            would otherwise increase to disruptive levels. When a keystone species is removed,
            community diversity suffers.
