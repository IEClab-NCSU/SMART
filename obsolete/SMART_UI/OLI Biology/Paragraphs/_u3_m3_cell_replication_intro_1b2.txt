DNA is the molecule
			that stores and transmits inherited genetic information. This information includes the
			directions that tell a cell how to make proteins. Information is stored in
			DNA in segments called genes. In the diagram above, the ruler represents
			the entire DNA molecule. The genes are represented as short segments of the ruler. You
			will learn more about the structure and function of genes in the Molecular Genetics unit.
