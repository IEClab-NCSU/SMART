An amino acid is a small organic chemical that is made up of four parts. There is a
			nitrogen-containing amino group on one end of an amino acid. The other end of an amino
			acid has a carboxylic acid group. These two groups (the amino group and the carboxylic
			acid group) are the reason for the name “amino acid.” The amino and carboxylic acid
			groups are linked by a single carbon atom called the alpha carbon. Finally, there is a
			variable “R group” also attached to the alpha carbon. The amino acids differ in the
			nature of the R group that is attached to the central alpha carbon. There are 20
			different R groups commonly found in nature. In this way, all amino acids are identical
			except for the different R groups (also called side chains) attached to the alpha
			carbon. The properties of different proteins depend entirely on the sequence, or
			arrangement, of the amino acids.
