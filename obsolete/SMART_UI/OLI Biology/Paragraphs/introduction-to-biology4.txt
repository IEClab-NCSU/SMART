Now that you have a better understanding of what Biology is, we are next going to consider what is the difference 
			between living and non-living things.  Then you will be introduced to the common themes of the course: Energy, Pathways 
			and Regulation.  You will find that these three concepts appear over and over again throughout the course.  Next this 
			unit will focus on the Hierarchy of Life. That is to say, you will begin to see how all of life is built from smaller 
			things that combine to form larger more complex ones.  Lastly, we will discuss the Scientific Method which is the foundation 
			of scientific inquiry and exploration.
