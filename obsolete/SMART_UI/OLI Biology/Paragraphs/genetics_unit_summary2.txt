In this unit you learned, through some of the groundbreaking experiments and observations
                    of scientists such as Mendel and Morgan, the most common inheritance patterns. From
                    simple dominance to polygenic inheritance, there are many ways the discrete units of
                    inheritance Mendel called “genes” (without knowing precisely what they were), can
                    combine and influence each other. However, not everything is determined by genes.
                    Further studies have shown that the environment plays an important role in how those
                    genes are or are not expressed. In the next unit, you will learn about how the genetic
                    information is inherited, expressed, and regulated at the molecular level.
