A covalent bond that forms between a highly electronegative atom
                                (e.g. N and O) and a non-highly electronegative atom. This results
                                in an uneven distribution of the charge (because the electrons spend
                                more time around the electronegative atom) causing one end of the
                                bond to have a more positive charge on the end with the
                                non-electronegative atom and a more negative charge on the end with
                                the electronegative atom.
