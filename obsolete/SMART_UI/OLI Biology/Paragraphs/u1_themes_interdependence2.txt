Your trillions of cells are intimately dependent on each other for
                            survival. Your cells are specialized, and you exist because of a massive
                            team effort from all these different cells. If any one of your major
                            organs were to suddenly fail, you might die very quickly. Moreover, your
                            health also depends on trillions upon trillions of bacterial cells that
                            live in and on your body. They provide your cells with vitamins, help
                            keep out invaders, and may even influence your mood. So your body itself
                            is a community of interdependent cells.
