The cycling that occurs between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is vital to the
			health of planet Earth. If there was no way for the carbon dioxide produced through
			cellular respiration to be utilized, respiring organisms (like humans, dogs, and even
			grass) would soon die of asphyxiation. Additionally, photosynthetic organisms are the
			base of almost every food chain on the planet, so without these organisms, mass
			starvation would ensue. Luckily, this planet is full of photosynthetic organisms. All of
			the breathable oxygen on Earth comes from photosynthesis. Just over half of the oxygen
			is produced by phytoplankton — drifting photosynthetic algae and bacteria — in the
			oceans. The rest comes from plants (trees, grass, etc.) on the land. Without this vital
			connection between photosynthesis and cellular respiration, life as we know it would
			cease to exist.
