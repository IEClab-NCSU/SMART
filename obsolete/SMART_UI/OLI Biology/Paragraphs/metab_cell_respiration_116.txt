Even though glucose is the starting substance used in cellular respiration,
					organisms do not consume pure glucose as an energy source. Instead, many
					different kinds of fuel molecules must be partly broken down and then fed into
					various stages of the cellular respiration pathway. For example, complex
					carbohydrates are readily converted to glucose or similar sugars. Fats and
					proteins can also be used in cellular respiration, but they must be modified
					before they can feed into the process.
