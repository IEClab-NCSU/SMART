The heart is divided into four chambers. The two lower chambers, called
                    ventricles, force blood out into the arteries. The two upper chambers of the
                    heart, called atria, receive blood returning from the veins. The heart contracts
                    as a unit, both atria (named right and left) contract together to move blood
                    into the ventricles and then both ventricles contract at the same time to move
                    blood out of the heart into the pulmonary artery and the aorta.
