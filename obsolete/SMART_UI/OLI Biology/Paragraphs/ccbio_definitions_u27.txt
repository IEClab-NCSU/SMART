Solutions which resist changes in pH by acting as either an acid or a base.
                        Blood is an example of a buffered solution. This means that if a small
                        amount of acid or base is introduced to the bloodstream, components in your
                        blood will neutralize the acid or base and the pH of your blood will change
                        only very slightly.
