Substances that dissolve in or are attracted to water. Hydrophilic (from
                        Greek meaning "water-loving") refers to molecules that are water soluble.
                        Ionic and polar substances are hydrophilic. That is, hydrophilic molecules
                        contain polar functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds
                        with water.
