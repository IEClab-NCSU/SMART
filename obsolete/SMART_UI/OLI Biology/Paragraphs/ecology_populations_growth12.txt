A contrasting model of growth is linear growth. Here a quantity
			grows by a constant number (not percentage) in each time
			interval. A series of numbers with this growth pattern would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and
			so on. Each time step the quantity increases by 2, no matter how big it might already
			be. In a graph, linear growth appears as a straight line. A staircase is linear: the
			risers are evenly spaced and you gain a set amount of height with each subsequent
			step.
