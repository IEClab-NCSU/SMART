It is not just four-limbed animals that are related. According to current evolutionary
            thinking, all life on Earth is related by ancestry. You, a bacterium, a fly, a fern, and
            a Portabello mushroom all belong to a single clade. To some, this is a difficult or even
            preposterous concept. What could you and a bacterium or mushroom possibly have in
            common? And if you do have something in common, why do biologists think it was inherited
            from the same source?
