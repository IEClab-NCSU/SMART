Chitin, a modified structural polysaccharide, is best known as a
					major component of the exoskeleton (hard outer shell) of arthropods (e.g.,
					beetles, crabs, lobsters) and mollusks (e.g., snails, clams, scallops). However,
					chitin also plays a minor role in the cell structure of some fungi, algae, and
					yeasts. Chitin (C8H13NO5)n is
					comprised of slightly-modified glucose monomers.
