Obesity is a condition in which body fat is excessive and interferes with normal function or
					impairs health. Obesity can make many physical activities difficult or
					impossible. It is associated with many increased health risks; type II diabetes
					(see below), hypertension, and heart disease are three serious conditions that
					are clearly more common among obese people than their normal-weight peers. Obese
					people also suffer socially and professionally because of weight-related bias
					and discrimination.
