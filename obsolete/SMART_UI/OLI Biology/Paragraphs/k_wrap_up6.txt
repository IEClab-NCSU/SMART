 Just as the pH scale indicates the relative proton concentration of various
					solutions, the pKa indicates the relative strengths of the different
					acids. If a reaction has a large equilibrium constant, then the concentration of
					the products will be higher than the reactants. In the case of the acidity
					constant, a larger Ka indicates a more completely dissociated acid,
					or a stronger acid. Since the pKa = - log (Ka), strong
					acids will have small pKa values.
