You already learned about PKU, a pleiotropic disorder caused by defects in a
                    single gene coding for an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to
                    tyrosine. Newborns are tested for this defect very early in life, so that if the
                    results are positive, they can be given a diet limiting phenylalanine ingestion.
                    That way, the toxic buildup is prevented and the children can develop normally.
                    PKU is an example in which environmental factors can modify gene expression.
