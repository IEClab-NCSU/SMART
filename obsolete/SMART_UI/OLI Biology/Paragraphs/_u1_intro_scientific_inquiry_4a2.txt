Pseudoscience is any claim that purports or pretends to be scientific in nature,
                    but does not actually have the characteristics of true scientific inquiry.
                    Pseudoscientific ideas often involve the supernatural. Sometimes they involve
                    claims about forces or processes that cannot be measured using traditional tools
                    or instruments employed by scientists. Finally, pseudoscientific claims are
                    often quite dramatic. They are “amazing” ideas that would seem strange or
                    unlikely to most scientists working in a related field.
