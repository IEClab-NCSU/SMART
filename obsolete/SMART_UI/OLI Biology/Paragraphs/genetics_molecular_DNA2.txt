The information stored in the order of bases is organized into genes: each gene contains
            information for making a functional product. The genetic information is first copied to
            another nucleic acid polymer, RNA (ribonucleic acid), preserving the order of the
            nucleotide bases. Genes that contain instructions for making proteins are converted to
            messenger RNA (mRNA). Some specialized genes contain instructions for making functional
            RNA molecules that donâ€™t make proteins. These RNA molecules function by affecting
            cellular processes directly; for example some of these RNA molecules regulate the
            expression of mRNA. Other genes produce RNA molecules that are required for protein
                synthesis, transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
