When needed, glucose is released from glycogen by a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme
        glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme breaks an 

-(1-4) linkage at the end of glycogen polymer by the addition of an inorganic
      phosphate. The product of this reaction, glucose-1-P, can enter glycolysis after conversion to
      glucose-6-P. Note that this entry point for glucose skips the first step in glycolysis,
      avoiding the need to activate glucose using ATP.
