 Placing acetic acid in pure water establishes an equilibrium between the charged
					and neutral forms according to the unique dissociation constant of the acid.
					This occurs because acetic acid is the only proton donor in the solution. What
					would happen if protons are added to the solution from another source, for
					example a strong acid, or a biochemical reaction that releases protons? Answer
					the question before continuing.
