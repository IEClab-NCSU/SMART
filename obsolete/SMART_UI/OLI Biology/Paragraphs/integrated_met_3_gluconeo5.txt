Since the first two reactions use ATP to drive an otherwise unfavorable reaction, the
          phosphorylation of sugars, the simpler reverse reaction, hydrolysis, will be favorable and
          spontaneous. Consequently, in gluconeogenesis these two steps are catalyzed by
          phosphatases instead of kinases. The third reaction in glycolysis, phosphoenol pyruvate
          (PEP) to pyruvate, has such a large decrease in energy that it cannot be easily reversed
          and must be accomplished by a different method.
