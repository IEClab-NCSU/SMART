In the previous modules in the Biological Chemistry unit, we have been learning about how
			atoms and molecules interact. The story of acids and bases begins with water
				(H2O). Water in the liquid state is highly dynamic. Not only are the
			hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules constantly forming and breaking, but
			some of the individual water molecules are breaking apart into hydrogen ions
				(H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) and reforming to make water. The
			two reactions (breaking apart and reforming) are in equilibrium, so at any instant in a
			sample of pure water there are equal proportions of H+ and OH-
