Now that we have a better understanding of what microevolution is, we must consider in
			more detail how microevolution happens. What are the mechanisms
			that allow for changes in the gene pool over time? In this page we will learn about
			selection, a central process in evolution. Selection occurs whenever some genetic types
			in a population reproduce more than others in a given environment. We will discuss three
			types of selection: natural, sexual, and artificial.
