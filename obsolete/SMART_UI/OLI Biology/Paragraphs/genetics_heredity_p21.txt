In The Cell unit 
                component structures of the cell were discussed. One of these
            components is the DNA, which is arranged into one or more chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
            many genes. A gene is a region of a chromosome that has a specific
            function. For example, genes can contain information required to make a protein. How
            this happens will be discussed in the Molecular Genetics
            Unit.
