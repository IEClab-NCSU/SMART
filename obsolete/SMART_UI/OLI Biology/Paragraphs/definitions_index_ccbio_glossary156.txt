Certain gases warm the climate by absorbing and re-emitting heat
                                radiation, keeping temperatures warmer and more stable near the
                                planetâ€™s surface. Humans have strengthened this effect by adding
                                extra greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Some results have included
                                increased temperatures, increased sea level, increasingly variable
                                weather, melting ice and permafrost, increasing droughts, shifts in
                                species distributions, and shifts in the timing of seasonal
                                events.
