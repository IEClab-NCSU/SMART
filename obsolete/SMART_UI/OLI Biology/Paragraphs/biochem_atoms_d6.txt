Opposite charges cancel each other out when they are close together. So what would you
					predict about the overall charge of an atom with an equal number of protons and
					electrons? That’s right — it is neutral. There is no charge; the atom will not
					be attracted to or repelled by charged objects. All atoms, in their elemental
					state, have equal numbers of protons and electrons, and for this reason they
					have no net charge.
