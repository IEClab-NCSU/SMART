The nucleus is the control center of the cell and
							it stores the DNA, which contains the instructions
							for how to build all the protein products required by the cell. The
							nucleus is like the factory command center, which stores the
							instructions needed to build its product. A single molecule of DNA is
							called a chromosome. The chromosomes are like the
							different books in the factoryâ€™s control center.
