Women with harmful mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 have an increased risk of breast
			cancer that is about five times the normal risk, and a risk of ovarian cancer that is
			about 10 to 30 times normal. While mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for only five to
			ten percent of all breast cancer cases in women, it is suggested that women with
			familial breast or ovarian cancer (when several female close relatives have or had
			cancer) be tested for BRCA mutations. Testing positive for BRCA mutations does not mean
			the person will definitely get breast cancer, because there are many other genetic and
			environmental factors involved. However, having this information may help those
			individuals to take preventive measures, such as more frequent mammograms.
