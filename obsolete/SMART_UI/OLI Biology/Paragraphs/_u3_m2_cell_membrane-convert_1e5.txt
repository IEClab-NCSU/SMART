You figured out that the structure of the archaean phospholipid is significantly
			different from the structure of the bacterial phospholipid. These structural differences
			lead to functional differences that enable archaeans to survive in extreme environments.
			This is an excellent example of how structure determines function at the cellular level
			of organization.
