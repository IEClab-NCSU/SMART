The rest of this module will focus on the methods of scientific inquiry. Contrary
					to many science textbooks, there is no single, universal scientific method. Scientists
					apply many methods to their research and there is no single, correct sequence of 
					scientific activities. Some types of research require hypothesis testing and
					strict, controlled laboratory conditions. Other types of research describe and 
					categorize organisms living in an area and the types of habitats they prefer. The 
					type of research being conducted by a scientist will determine research design, the
					methods and tools used to gather and analyze data, and the ability of scientists
					to generalize their findings beyond their study. Often this means scientists will
					make observations before defining the problem or forming a hypothesis!
