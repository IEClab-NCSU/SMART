If complete replacement of dATP with ddATP were made, then the first time a T were
          encountered in the template strand, DNA polymerase would incorporate ddATP and all
          synthesis would halt. If however, a mixture of dATP and ddATP were present, then when the
          first T were encountered in the template, the dATP and ddATP would compete for the active
          site of DNA polymerase. If dATP is incorporated, synthesis continues to the next
          nucleotide and if ddTAP is incorporated synthesis halts for that one strand of DNA. Thus
          in a population of template strands, a fragment of DNA starting at the primer and ending
          at each T would be generated with the length of the fragment in nucleotide units defines
          the location of the T in the template strand. If this experiment is performed for each
          individual nucleotide, the complete sequence of the template can be accomplished.
