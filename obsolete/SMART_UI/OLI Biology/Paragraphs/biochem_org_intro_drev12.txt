 The link below will open the Functional Groups Glossary. We will use this
					glossary extensively. It contains the functional groups organized based on
					properties and is rich with information and examples about each of the groups.
					Click on "Learn By Doing" below, to enter the tutorial.
					The functional groups are listed in the center column. You can click on each
					group to see the chemical properties, as well as several examples of molecules,
					associated with that group. The 3-D structure viewer is interactive; click and
					drag the structure to rotate it. You can also use radio buttons to select groups
					of molecules to explore how the groups are related functionally.
