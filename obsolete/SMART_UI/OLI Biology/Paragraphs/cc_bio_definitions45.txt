 Weak electrostatic attraction that occurs between the partial positive
                        charge on the H atom of one polar molecule and the partial negative charge
                        in some region of another polar molecule. The separation of charge within a
                        molecule (required for hydrogen bonding between molecules) usually occurs
                        where an electronegative element (usually O or N) is bonded to a hydrogen
                        atom.
