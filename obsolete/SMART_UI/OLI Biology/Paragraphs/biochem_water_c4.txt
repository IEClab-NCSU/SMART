Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life. For example,
					because of these
				forces, water can flow up tubes within plants. These tubes connect the roots of
					plants to their leaves, and carry water to plant tissues. Adhesion helps water
					cling to the walls of the tubes, and cohesion keeps the water in an intact
					column. Without these properties of water, tall plants would be unable to
					receive the water and nutrients they require, and they would die.
