Two tools that have become integral parts of the study of modern biology were developed
          through the simple understanding of how the DNA replication process works. At the
          beginning of this unit three structural requirements for the substrate of DNA polymerase
          were described. Satisfying those requirements is the basis for the polymerase chain
            reaction (PCR), used to amplify segments of DNA, and the Sanger DNA
          sequencing method used in sequencing the human genome as well as others.
