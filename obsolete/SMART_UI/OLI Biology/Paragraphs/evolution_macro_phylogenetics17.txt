As you have learned, shared characteristics can be used to organize species into groups,
            with clades defined by unique inherited traits. Unfortunately, this procedure is often
            quite difficult: there are millions of species to organize and an infinite number of
            possible characteristics to compare! Many traits may be lost or reversed over time.
            Consider the examples of tetrapods with one or both pairs of limbs reduced or missing
            (snakes, some lizards, whales and dolphins, manatees, seals, etc.). Some changes also
            occur quite predictably as adaptations to special environments. In the Arctic, foxes,
            birds, mink, hares, bears, and more all have snow-white winter coats or feathers. They
            are not closely related and did not all inherit their winter coloration from a common
            ancestor. Instead, “snow white winter color” developed independently in each of these
            lineages at different times and starting with different mutations.
