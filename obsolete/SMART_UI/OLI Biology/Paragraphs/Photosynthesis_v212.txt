Some photosynthetic organisms (such as algae and bacteria) live in water and can absorb it directly. In land plants, however, the above-ground portions of the plant have evolved to reduce water loss; one consequence of this is that land plants can no longer absorb water directly through all parts of the plant. Instead, land plants absorb water from the ground (through their roots) and then must transport this water throughout the entire plant.
