The most stable situation for an atom is to have its outer shell completely filled with
			electrons. It is not easy to explain why this is true, but it is a rule of thumb that
			predicts how atoms will react with each other. Recall from the discussion on electrons, in the
				Atoms module,
			that the first electron shell is full with two electrons, and the second and third
			shells are full with eight electrons. Atoms tend to bond to other atoms in such a way
			that both atoms have filled outer shells as a result of the interaction.
