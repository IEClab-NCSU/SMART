Sometimes people use the phrase “survival of the fittest” to sum up natural
					selection. This catchphrase may be helpful, but we encourage you to think
					carefully. “Survival” is important, but only because it enables reproduction:
					once they reach reproductive age, some animals and plants literally kill
					themselves to reproduce. Examples include many salmon and annual plants, which
					put all of their energy into a single reproductive effort.
