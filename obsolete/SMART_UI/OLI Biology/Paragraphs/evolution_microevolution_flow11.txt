Genetic drift can also occur through the founder effect. In the
			founder effect, a small number of individuals from a population settle in a new area.
			This small group is not likely to contain all of the alleles of the original population,
			just as is seen with the survivors in the bottleneck effect. Imagine a field of
			dandelions. Dandelions are self-fertile, so they do not require cross pollination from
			other dandelions to produce offspring. If just one of the white fluffy dandelion seeds
			is carried by the breeze to a new location that does not have dandelions, the plant from
			this single seed could start a new population. As a result of the founder effect,
			however, the gene pool of the new population would be very limited. It would have only
			those alleles that were found in the original seed, drawn at random from a much larger
			source population.
