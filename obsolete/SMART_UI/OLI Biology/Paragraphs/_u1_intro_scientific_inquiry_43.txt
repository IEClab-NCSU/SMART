Whether the outcome is significant often depends on the size of study; the larger the number
					of individuals enrolled, the more convincing the results are likely to be. For
					example, imagine only 10 women were enrolled in the study. In the control group,
					2 in 5 of the women became infected. In the experimental group, 0 in 5 were
					infected. At first you might think this proves the vaccineâ€™s effectiveness, but
					it is NOT a convincing or significant result. Why not? Random events could
					easily explain the difference between the groups. For example, perhaps none of
					the five women in the experimental group were sexually active over the study
					period. They therefore stood no chance of acquiring HPV. The vaccine might
					appear to work, but a skeptical reader could account for the results by
					proposing many other scenarios.
