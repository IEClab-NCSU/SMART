Because of its complex life cycle and the eukaryotic nature of this organism, malaria has
			been a difficult disease to combat. However, this complexity also means that there are
			more potential ways to intervene, prevent, and treat this disease. The parasite could be
			targeted with anti-malarial drugs in the human host. Other methods could be used to
			prevent the parasite from surviving in the mosquito host. Or measures can be taken to
			prevent the human host from being bitten by mosquitoes.
