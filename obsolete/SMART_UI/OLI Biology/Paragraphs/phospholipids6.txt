An unsaturated fat has at least one unsaturated fatty acid, whereas a
							saturated fat has none. Because the double bonds of the unsaturated
							fatty acids introduce kinks in the hydrocarbon backbone, unsaturated
							fats will not pack into a regular structure and thus remain fluid at
							lower temperatures. A saturated fat will pack well and be a solid a low
							temperatures.
