Mutualistic, or mutually beneficial, relationships are widespread
			and important features of communities. Sometimes mutualism also involves symbiosis. Many
			animals and plants are host to microorganisms that provide them with vital functions. In
			other cases, equally important mutualistic transactions are carried out at a distance:
			not all mutualisms are symbiotic. Plants, for example, reward animals for transportation
			services that allow them to mate (pollination) and travel as seeds (seed dispersal).
			Animals also may help each other in subtle ways.
