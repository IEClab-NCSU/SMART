Radioactive isotopes can be used to visualize certain tissues for medical diagnosis. One
			example of this is radioactive iodine, which tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland.
			It emits radiation as it breaks down to another isotope of iodine. Special cameras can
			pick up this radiation and use it to create an image of the thyroid gland to determine
			if the patient's thyroid is functioning normally. If there is abnormal activity in the
			thyroid gland, this can indicate cancer.
