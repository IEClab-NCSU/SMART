The bases do not occur as free bases in nature but are always bound to a furanose ring.
          Since the bases are always associated with a sugar in nature, they take on specific names
          according to their structure. The base by itself has a specific name and the base attached
          to a sugar (a nucleoside) has a distinct name. The following table gives the names of the
          purines and pyrimidines as the free base and as the nucleoside with their one letter
          abbreviation. The naming of the nucleotidesA component of nucleic acids consisting of a sugar, usually ribose or deoxyribose, a purine or pyrimidine base, and a phosphate group attached either at the 5 prime or 3 prime position of the sugar ring. is analogous to the 
          nucleosideA component of nucleic acids consisting of a sugar, usually ribose or deoxyribose, and a purine or pyrimidine base. A compound obtained by hydrolysis of a nucleic acid.
          with the added specification of the location of the phosphate group. An example
          of this nomeclature is given below the table with the structures.
