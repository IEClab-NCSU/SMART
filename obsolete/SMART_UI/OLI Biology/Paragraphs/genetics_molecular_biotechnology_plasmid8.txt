The expression plasmid must have a DNA sequence that will encode a ribosome binding
                        site on the mRNA. This sequence, which will be found at the beginning of the
                        mRNA, will allow the mRNA to bind to the bacterial ribosome, initiating the
                        process of protein synthesis. This segment must be part of the mRNA and it
                        has to occur just before the start codon to position the mRNA correctly on
                        the ribosome.
