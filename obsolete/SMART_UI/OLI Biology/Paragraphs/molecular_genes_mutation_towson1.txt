None of the processes discussed so far are free of errors. Errors can be made during
			transcription if incorrect nucleotides are incorporated into the growing RNA strands.
			Errors can happen during translation if incorrect amino acids are inserted into a
			growing protein, or if translation is terminated too soon. Errors during gene expression
			have generally short-lived effects and can be overcome by additional RNA or protein
			synthesis.
