Product formation ceases beyond the critical point due to two effects of
					temperature. One effect is to decrease the non-covalent interactions between
					enzyme and substrate. Remember that ionic and hydrogen bonds are weak
					non-covalent bonds representing 5 Kcal/mole each.only 5 kcal/mol in strength.
					When the temperature increase matches the energy of the bond, the energy cn be
					used to break the bond. Thus if the enzyme cannot bind the substrate, no product
					is formed.
