Evolution is a scientific
            theory that explains how and why life changes over time. Evolution provides the
            explanation for why all living organisms share profound similarities, and yet, the life
            forms on our planet are so incredibly diverse. The two fundamental tenets of evolution
            are shared ancestry and natural selection.
