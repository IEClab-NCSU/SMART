By reversibly binding oxygen, myoglobin acts as an oxygen buffer. When free oxygen is high
		myoglobin binds oxygen and the equilibrium shifts to the right. If the oxygen
		concentration falls the equilibrium shifts to the left to free oxygen and protein. The
		change in equilibrium is only possible because protein ligand binding is reversible. The
		direction of the equilibrium, either towards more complex or towards free reactants,
		depends primarily on the amount of free oxygen in the cell. Oxygen supply is always
		changing depending on activity level. Myoglobin supply is essentially constant in the
		cell since protein synthesis is relatively a much slower process.
