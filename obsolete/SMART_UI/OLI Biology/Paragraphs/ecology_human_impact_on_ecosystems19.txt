Warm weather and ocean temperatures. In a record of weather
                    and ocean temperature data stretching back to 1900, the top five warmest years
                    were 2005, 2010, 1998, 2003, and 2002. Studies based on weather stations and
                    ocean temperature measurements around the world have repeatedly found a trend of
                    increasing temperatures since about 1900 with steep increases since around 1970.
                    The data for land weather stations are summarized in the graph below. As average
                    temperatures have increased, so has the frequency of extreme heat waves. These
                    are particularly dangerous in low-income nations like India, where people lack
                    air conditioning.
