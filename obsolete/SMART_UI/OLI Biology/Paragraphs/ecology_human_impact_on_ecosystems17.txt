Many other ongoing natural processes have an influence on the climate. Why do
                    scientists think greenhouse gas increases are the factor driving the recent
                    warming? Again, natural processes have not changed in a way that can explain the
                    observed warming of the climate. For example, the sun’s energy output changes
                    over time, and this can influence our climate. But these changes cannot account
                    for recent global warming. In fact, the sun’s energy output was considerably
                    lower than normal from 2005 to 2010, but the climate continued to warm over that
                    period.
