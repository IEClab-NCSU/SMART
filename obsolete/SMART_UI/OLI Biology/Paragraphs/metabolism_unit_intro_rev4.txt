Metabolic pathways are either anabolic or catabolic.
						Anabolic pathways involve the use of energy and simple
					organic building blocks to create more complex molecules.
							Catabolic pathways convert complex molecules to
					simpler ones, releasing energy for use by the organism. In the Pathways and Regulation module, you will learn the
					differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways.
