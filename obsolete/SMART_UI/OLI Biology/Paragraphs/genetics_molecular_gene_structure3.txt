To encode a protein, mRNA needs a protein-coding region and regulatory regions. The
            coding region of the gene (and the coding region of mRNA) has to start with a start
            codon: ATG in DNA and AUG in mRNA code for the amino acid methionine, Met. The coding
            region of a gene always ends with a stop codon TAA, TAG, or TGA (in mRNA, these will
            have a U instead of a T). The sequence between start and stop codons should contain
            nucleotides in multiples of three, encoding the sequence of amino acids in the protein.
            The untranslated regulatory regions (denoted by UTR) include a site for the ribosome to
            bind before the start codon (5’ UTR) and a region after the stop codon (3’ UTR). Both 5’
            and 3’ UTRs can bind specific proteins involved in regulation of translation (how fast
            new protein product is built, how fast mRNA is degraded).
