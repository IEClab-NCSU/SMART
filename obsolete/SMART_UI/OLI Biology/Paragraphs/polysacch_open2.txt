Carbohydrates generally exist as di- and polysaccharides used in transport, energy
			storage, structure and signaling. While the glycosidic bond is always between the
			anomeric carbon of one carbohydrate and the hydroxyl of another carbohydrate, the number
			of hydroxyls per monosaccharide and the different orientations of the hydroxyl on the
			anomeric carbon make the number of potential structures extremely large. Here we will
			focus on some of the biologically important di- and polysaccharides with an emphasis on
			the ability to identify and describe the structures not the ability to draw the
			structures.
