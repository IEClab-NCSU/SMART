Our goals for this course are for learners to understand the basic process of
					scientific inquiry and be able to critically evaluate information that claims to
					be “scientific.” We aim for learners to become scientifically literate
					participants in social discussions and policy debates on issues such as:
					personal health and medicine; opportunities and challenges posed by new medical
					technologies; and, human effects on the environment. Upon completing this
					course, learners will be able to understand and dialogue about biological
					principles and concepts relating to: cell biology, energy balance and nutrition,
					reproduction and genetics, diversity of life, and evolution.
