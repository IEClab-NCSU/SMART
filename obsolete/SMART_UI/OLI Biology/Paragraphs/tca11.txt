If compounds in the TCA cycle are used to synthesize other compounds, such as amino acids, the TCA cycle will
          eventually halt due to depletion of oxaloacetate.   Consequently it is necessary to "fill
          up" the TCA cycle with an "anaplerotic" reaction. In this case, pyruvate is
          converted to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase:
