 Biological systems use only a small subset of the elements (approximately 10 %) found in
			the periodic table. The chemical reactions that take place in cells represent only a
			small subset of all possible reactions. Before we begin an in-depth study of other
			aspects of molecular and cellular biology, one needs to understand the restrictions the
			cellular environment places on the possible chemical reactions and the resulting
			structures. By learning about the characteristics of the subset atoms, and a limited set
			of functional groups found in biological molecules, you will be able to identify, and
			predict many of the reactions that can take place, understand and predict the physical
			properties of the molecules made by these reactions, and develop an understanding of why
			a process occurs as it does in a cell.
