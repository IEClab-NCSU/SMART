At the smallest level, the structure of molecules determines their
				function within cells. For example, enzymes are critically important proteins that
				speed up the rate of chemical reactions that support life. Enzymes break down food
				molecules, help build a muscle proteins, help destroy toxins, and much more. An
				enzymeâ€™s ability to function depends directly on its three-dimensional shape. If
				exposed to excessive heat or harsh chemical conditions, enzymes unravel and change
				in shape. When this occurs, the enzymes stop working and the chemical reactions of
				life slow down or cease.
