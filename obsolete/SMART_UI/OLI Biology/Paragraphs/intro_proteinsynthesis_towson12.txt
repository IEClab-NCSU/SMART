The following animation describes the formation of the initiation complex, the elongation
			of the peptide during synthesis and the termination of the synthesis at the termination
			or stop codon. The process is fundamentally the same for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The
			one notable exception is in the binding of the mRNA with the small subunit of the
			ribosome during formation of the initiation complex. Prokaryotes do not have a 5’cap to
			identify the end of the mRNA but they do have a consensus sequence called the
			Shine-Dalgarno-Sequence at the 5’ end of the mRNA. This sequence is used to align the
			mRNA with the appropriate site on the ribosomal subunit. In eukaryotic organisms the
			5’cap provides the alignment along with multiple initiation factors. Following formation
			of the initiation complex, the synthesis of protein follows the same sequence in both
			organisms.
