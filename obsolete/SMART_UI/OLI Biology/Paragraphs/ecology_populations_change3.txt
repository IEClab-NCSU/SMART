By calculating rates we can make fair comparisons between
			populations regardless of their size. The simplest way to do this is by using per capita
			(literally “per head”) rates where population size is included in the denominator of a
			rate calculation. Per capita rates can be calculated for events like birth and death or
			even occurrences like murders or car accidents. In each case, the calculation is
			equivalent.
