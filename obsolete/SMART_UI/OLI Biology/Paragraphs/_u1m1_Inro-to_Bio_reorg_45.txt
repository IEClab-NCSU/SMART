During and just after World War II, penicillin was touted as a wonder drug, and
					many believed the battle against pathogenic (harmful) bacteria would be won in a
					matter of years. However, the initial success of this antibiotic was relatively
					short-lived, as bacteria began to evolve resistance to the drug. In any group of
					bacteria, individuals can have variations in their genetic makeup that help them
					survive in the presence of specific antibiotic compounds. Over time, if the
					antibiotic is used, vulnerable types of bacteria die out and the “resistant”
					types of bacteria reproduce much better than average. Eventually most or all
					bacteria in the environment are resistant, making the antibiotic useless.
