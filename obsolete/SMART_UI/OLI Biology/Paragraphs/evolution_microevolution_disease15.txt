Malaria is a serious disease with an estimated 216 million cases and over 600,000 deaths
			in 2010. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria rates are highest, a child under the age
			of five dies every minute from this disease. Doctors and scientists are working to help
			prevent and treat this disease by designing new treatments, developing vaccines, working
			to prevent mosquitoes from transmitting the malaria parasites, and by studying the
			interrelatedness between the parasite, the insect host and the human host. At the center
			of the connection between parasite, insect, and human lies evolution.
