The expression plasmid would have two different restriction sites after the
            ribosome binding site to facilitate the insertion of the synthetic gene. To
            utilize these sites it would be necessary to include these restriction sites at
            the end of our synthetic gene. The expression plasmid and the synthetic fragment
            would be cut with the restriction enzymes, mixed, and then treated with DNA
            ligase to re-seal the phosphodiester backbone:
