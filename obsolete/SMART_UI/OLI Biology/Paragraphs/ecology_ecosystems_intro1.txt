Up to this point, we have focused on the living components of the environment. Consider a
			suburban backyard that is home to diverse species, including robins, squirrels, ants,
			oak trees, grass, rabbits, daisies, spiders, toads, mushrooms, and raccoons. These
			living, or biotic, components together make up an ecological community. Its populations
			affect each other directly and indirectly as we just explored. But each population also
			interacts with a host of nonliving factors. A grass plant, for instance, requires light,
			carbon dioxide gas, soil nutrients, and water. It is affected by temperature and by
			factors like snow cover or fires. In turn, it influences nonliving factors as well. Its
			roots, for example, hold soil in place.
