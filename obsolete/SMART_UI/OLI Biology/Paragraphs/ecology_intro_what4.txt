Many students have some difficulty distinguishing between the definitions of
					ecological community and ecosystem. The community and ecosystem levels can cover exactly the
					same area: communities are not literally “smaller than” or “contained within”
					ecosystems. Instead, the ecosystem is a different way of looking at an area that
					includes a broader set of factors and processes than the community level of
					analysis. The community ecologist looks at a forest and sees particular types of
					birds, trees, fungi, and insects eating each other and otherwise interacting.
					The ecosystem ecologist looks at the same forest and may see the organisms in
					less detail, but also considers how the trees build the soil or how floods shape
					the landscape.
