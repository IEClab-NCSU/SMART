Earthâ€™s immortal atoms move through living things as we feed, breathe, and excrete solid and liquid wastes.  The same atoms are also found in abiotic reservoirs, stored up within rocks, soil, water, and air.  They bond with other elements to take shape as many different materials.  Carbon, for example, makes up the backbone of all organic macromolecules.  Outside of life, it exists as carbon dioxide gas that mixes into the air and dissolves into water.  This gas gives carbonated beverages their fizz.  Limestone rock, coal, and diamonds are some solid materials rich in carbon.
