 Attractions between atoms that hold atoms and molecules together.
                                There are three major types of chemical bonds that are important in
                                biology: i) covalent, ii) ionic, and iii) hydrogen bonds.
                                Covalent bonds occur when two atoms share electrons. Ionic bonds
                                occur when two oppositely charged ions stick together.
