Energy and matter move through living systems in different ways. Energy flows through
                    living systems, changing forms as it goes. For example, the energy in sunlight
                    is captured by green plants, which use this energy to build sugar molecules. The
                    energy from the sun is now stored in the sugar and when an organism eats the
                    sugar, the stored energy can be harvested and used to do work. The energy flows
                    through the system; it is never recycled.  Matter, on the other hand, cycles within
                    living systems. For example, the atoms in the sugar molecule start out as
                    nutrients, and will ultimately become waste. The waste might become nutrients
                    for something else. Those same atoms will be used over and over again. Energy
                    flow and nutrient cycling are themes in biology at every level.
