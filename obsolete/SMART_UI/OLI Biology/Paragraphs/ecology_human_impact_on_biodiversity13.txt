Much of the world’s remaining biodiversity is in the tropics within low- and
            moderate-income nations. Here, the biodiversity situation remains much more troubling.
            Resources for conservation efforts are limited and high rates of human population growth
            continue to drive habitat destruction and overharvesting in many of these nations.
            Poaching (illegal hunting), forest destruction, poorly regulated mining, overfishing,
            and destructive farming and livestock grazing practices are all contributing to
            biodiversity decline that threatens thousands of unique and irreplaceable species. On
            the positive side, conservationists are working very hard to protect wild habitats
            within “biodiversity hotspots” that harbor a large diversity of species. Nongovernmental
            organizations from high-income nations are spearheading these efforts. Through
            investments and education, they are working with communities to develop sustainable
            businesses that provide income while protecting the integrity of local ecosystems.
