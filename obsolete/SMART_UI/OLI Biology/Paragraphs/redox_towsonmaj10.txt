 In most biochemical redox reactions a total of two electrons are transferred. These
          electrons are often transferred as hydrogen atoms, containing a proton and electron. Two
          common electron acceptors are NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD
          (flavin adenine dinucleotide). They both can accept two electrons, giving the reduced
          forms NADH and FADH2, respectively. The structure of the oxidized forms of
          these compounds are shown below.
