Along the coast of western North America, rocky areas are often home to a spectacular
			community called the kelp forest. It is dominated by kelp, big brown algae (seaweeds)
			whose fronds can stretch to dozens of meters in length. Kelp are clearly the foundation
			species of the kelp forest: they provide food and shelter to a huge diversity of fish
			and invertebrates including such economically important species as lobster and
			rockfish.
