 In the tutorial you learned that the equilibrium constant Ka is the
					same for an acid regardless of the starting concentration. Ka
					describes the relationship between the concentration of the protonated acid and
					the charged dissociated species at equilibrium. You also saw that even though
						Ka is constant, the values of the concentration of each species
					was varying over time. After an initial rapid dissociation of the acid, an
					equilibrium was reached. At equilibrium, the number of individual molecules will
					fluctuate, but on average, a balance, or equilibrium mixture, is maintained. The
					balance of products and reactants is defined by Ka.
