During anaphase, the kinetochore proteins break down the microtubules attached to
					them and the connections between each copy of the chromosome will be broken
					down. This causes the individual chromosomes to move to opposite poles of the
					cell. The root “ana-” refers to “apart”; the chromosomes are moving apart from
					each other.
