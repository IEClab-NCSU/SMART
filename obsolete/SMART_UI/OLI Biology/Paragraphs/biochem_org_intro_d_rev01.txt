Functional groups are parts of organic molecules that have specific
			properties and functions. Organic molecules may contain more than one type of functional
			group, and therefore, a particular molecule may have multiple properties. Biological
			systems use only a small subset of the total number of elements (approximately 10 %)
			found in the periodic table. This is due to the number of chemical reactions that can
			occur under physiological conditions, and to the small number of chemical or functional
			groups compatible in biological systems. The physical properties of functional groups
			define how molecules behave in biological systems at various physiological pH levels and
			temperatures. Identifying functional groups in molecules is an important skill, because
			once you identify a moleculeâ€™s functional groups, you can predict its chemical
			properties and many aspects of its biological behavior.
