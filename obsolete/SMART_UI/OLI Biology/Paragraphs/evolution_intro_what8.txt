“Bleached” form of lesser earless lizard (Holbrookia maculata) from White Sands National
            Monument, a region of white-sand dunes in New Mexico. The light color of lizards from
            this population results from a known mutation in a pigmentation gene and helps them
            avoid detection by visual predators.
