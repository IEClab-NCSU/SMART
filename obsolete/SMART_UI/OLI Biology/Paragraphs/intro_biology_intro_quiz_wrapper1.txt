As you’ve seen, life is an emergent property characterized by specific qualities.
                    The cell is the first level of organization that is alive and therefore the cell
                    is considered the fundamental unit of life. In the next module, you will learn
                    about several themes that emerge when studying living systems. These themes will
                    appear over and over throughout this course. But before moving onto the next
                    module, take some time to review the content you’ve learned so far. You can
                    start by making sure you’re comfortable with the key terms listed below. When
                    you are ready, you can check your understanding of this module by taking the “Introduction to Biology” quiz.
