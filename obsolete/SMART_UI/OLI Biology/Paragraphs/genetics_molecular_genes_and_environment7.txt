One example of epigenetic silencing in somatic cells is common to all female
                    mammals. One of the two X chromosomes in females is inactivated by epigenetic
                    mechanisms (DNA methylation and histone modifications). The results of
                    X-inactivation can be observed in calico or tortoiseshell cats. These cats are
                    almost always female. The gene encoding the coat color resides on the X
                    chromosome. A female cat (with two X chromosomes) could potentially carry one
                    allele for a black coat and one allele for an orange coat. As a result, her
                    phenotype will end up with patches of two different colors. This is because
                    cells that inactivate the X chromosome with the black allele will express the
                    orange allele, and after multiple cell divisions, a patch of orange fur will
                    result. Cells that inactivate the X chromosome carrying the orange allele will
                    give rise to black patches. The specific pattern of black and orange patches is
                    not heritable because X-inactivation is random.
