As you can see, 100 percent of the offspring have the Bb genotype, but 100 percent also
            show the purple phenotype. You might expect the offspring to show a phenotype that
            somehow blends the parental phenotypes. Sometimes this happens, but in the case of these
            pea plants' flower color, the purple allele (B) is dominant over the white
            allele (b). Stated another way, the white allele (b) is recessive to the purple
            allele (B).
