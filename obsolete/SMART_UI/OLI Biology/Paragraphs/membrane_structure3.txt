Because the cell membrane is only semipermeable, the cell needs a
									way to communicate with other cells and exchange nutrients with
									the extracellular space. These roles are primarily filled by
									proteins. Membrane proteins are classified into two major
									categories, integral proteins and peripheral proteins.Â  Integral
									membrane proteins are those proteins that are embedded in the
									lipid bilayer and are generally characterized by their
									solubility in non-polar, hydrophobic solvents. Transmembrane
									proteins are examples of integral proteins with hydrophobic
									regions that completely span the hydrophobic interior of the
									membrane. The parts of the protein exposed to the interior and
									exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. Integral proteins can
									serve as pores that selectively allow ions or nutrients into the
									cell. They also transmit signals into and out of the cell.
									Unlike integral proteins that span the membrane, peripheral
									proteins reside on only one side of the membrane and are often
									attached to integral proteins. Some peripheral proteins serve as
									anchor points for the cytoskeleton or extracellular fibers.
									Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly. Some
									move in seemingly directed manner while others drift.
