Below is a Punnett square of a cross between two fruit flies. The phenotypes of the
                offspring and the parents are given. Using what you know about the genotypes for eye
                color in fruit flies and the phenotype information in the chart below, determine
                which chromosome allele (X+ , Xw, or Y) belongs in boxes I,
                II, III, or IV. Boxes I and II represent the genotype of the female parent, and
                boxes III and IV represent the genotype of the male parent.
