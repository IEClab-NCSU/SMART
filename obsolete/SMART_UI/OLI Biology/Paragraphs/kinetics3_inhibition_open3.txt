A common way of regulating enzyme activity is by increasing or decreasing
					the amount of enzyme by regulation of the rates of synthesis in the cell.
					If you recall, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration
					of the enzyme-substrate complex ([ES]).  The concentration of this complex
					can be increased in two ways: i) either by increasing [S], which you
					explored on the previous page, or ii) by increasing the total amount of
					enzyme in the cell.
