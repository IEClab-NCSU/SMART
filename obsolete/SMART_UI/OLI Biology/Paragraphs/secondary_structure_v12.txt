Since there is no rotation around the C-N bond of the peptide bond, the only possible freedom of rotation in an amino acid residue is the carbonyl carbon-alpha carbon single bond, which is denoted as psi(), and the amide nitrogen-alpha carbon single bond, which is called phi(). If one knows all of the phi-psi angles of rotation for every amino acid residue in a protein, it is possible to define the secondary structure of that protein. It should be noted that not all phi-psi angles are possible due to steric interference, electronic repulsion by side chains of the same charge and other factors all of which represent constraints in the folding of a protein.
