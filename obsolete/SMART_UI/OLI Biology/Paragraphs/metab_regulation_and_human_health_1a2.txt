Note that when “calories” are being discussed in reference to food consumption, the word
			"calorie" actually refers to a kilocalorie. One kilocalorie is the amount of energy
			required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. It is
			the unit typically used when discussing human nutrition and energy balance. For your
			reference, a typical adult male requires about 2,500 calories per day; a female of
			average size might require 2,000 calories daily. The body’s calorie requirement declines
			with age, and depends on many factors, including body size, sex, and physical
			activity.
