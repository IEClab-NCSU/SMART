As you just learned, greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere retain heat and
                    keep surface temperatures warm and relatively steady over time. This phenomenon
                    is called the greenhouse effect. It is a natural part of
                    the Earth’s climate system and helps make our planet livable. Currently,
                    however, the greenhouse effect is strengthened by a high and increasing level of
                    greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Evidence indicates that human activity is
                    responsible for this increase.
