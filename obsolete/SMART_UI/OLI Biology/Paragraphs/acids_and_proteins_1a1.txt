There are many ways to represent an amino acid. Sometimes the carbon are indicated by
			intersecting lines, instead of the letter C. Sometimes the chemical bonds are given
			shapes that indicate the three dimensional structure of the molecule. Other times, the
			entire molecule is represented in a diagramatic fashion, such as in the “building block”
			representation. This model enables you to more easily visualize the important aspects of
			the molecule, though information about structural form is lacking. In the next module,
			you will use building block models of amino acids to figure out how proteins
			areformed.
