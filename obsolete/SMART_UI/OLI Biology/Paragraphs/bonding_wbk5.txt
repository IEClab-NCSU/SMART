Double bonds: Two carbons attached by a double covalent bond can only
					undergo 180 degree rotations and the atoms bound to these carbons are
					constrained to lie in the same plane as the carbon atom.. Rotation about the
					carbon-carbon bond has structural implications for molecules in which they are
					found. For example, the type of bond can influence the fluidity of biological
					membranes and restrict the folding of proteins.
