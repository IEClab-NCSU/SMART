How much of our physiological makeup is determined by genetics, and
            how much is determined by other factors, such as personal choice and environment? This
            question is a source of ongoing debate in both scientific and philosophical communities.
            Environmental factors can influence our DNA, and our DNA can influence how we react to
            environmental factors. If we are ever able to answer this question, the answer will
            likely be complex.
