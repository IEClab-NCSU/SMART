Two or more atoms held together by a chemical bond. Composition and
                                size are two charateristics of a molecule. The diagram below
                                illustrates a molecule of methane (CH4) consisting of
                                four hydrogen (H) atoms covalently bonded to one carbon (C)
                                atom.
