As you have just seen, the logistic model indicates that a harvestable population should
			be maintained at a moderate size of about half its carrying capacity. At this point
			there is a large increment of growth each year and these individuals can be harvested.
			This is the general framework used by fisheries managers as they seek to maintain and
			improve the productivity of fish populations. They often set regulations and allowable
			harvest limits to try to keep populations close to the “sweet spot” at about 50% of
			carrying capacity.
