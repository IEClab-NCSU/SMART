Cells of all organisms make ATP by breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. ATP is a relatively
			unstable molecule; consequently, it is never used for the long-term storage of energy in
			the cell. This job goes to other more stable compounds, like fats and sugars. However,
			ATP is specialized for direct and rapid transfers of energy. The bond between the second
			and the third phosphates can be broken in a reaction producing ADP (adenosine diphosphate) with 'di'
			indicating two phosphate groups. When the bond between the first and second phosphates
			is broken, energy is released, and produces AMP (adenosine monophosphate)
			with mono indicating one phosphate group. Energy is releaased
			when ATP reacts with water to form ADP or AMP. The energy released in these reactions
			can be used for chemical reactions (such as protein synthesis), molecule transport, or
			cellular work (such as muscle contractions). Conversely, if there is a surplus of
			energy, specialized reactions can produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate, storing the
			energy temporarily before being used for other processes.
