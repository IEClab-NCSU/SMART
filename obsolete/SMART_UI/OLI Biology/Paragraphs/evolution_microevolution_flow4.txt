Mutations in genes are random and have the potential to change the gene pool of a
			population. When parents produce sperm or eggs, errors (mutations) can occur so that the
			gametes carry new versions (alleles) of existing genes. Fertilization, growth, and
			development can result in an adult individual that carries a new allele and is able to
			pass it on to offspring. Technically, the birth of a single individual carrying a new
			mutation qualifies as microevolution: as soon as the new allele appears, the gene pool
			has been altered.
