Energy is required to sustain life. All organisms use a source of energy
							for their metabolic activities. Some organisms use energy from the sun
							while others use chemical energy. Humans, for instance, obtain energy
							from food. In this unit, we will take a closer look at what energy is
							and explore how different cells acquire and use energy.
