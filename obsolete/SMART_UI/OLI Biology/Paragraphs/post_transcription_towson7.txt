The addition of the 5’-cap and the polyA tail are depicted in the figure above. But, one
        of the most intriguing post-transcriptional modifications is the splicing out of
        segments of the mRNA called Introns. Introns are sequences that do not code for
        protein, are interspersed in the original DNA and are removed from the RNA transcript by the
        process of splicing. The splicing is carried out by a complex (quaternary structure) of
        proteins referred to as the splicesome composed of SnRNPs (Small Nuclear
        RiboNucleoProteins). The segments of RNA that do code for protein are called Exons.
        Signaled by nucleotide sequences in the ends of the introns, the splicesome brings together
        the 3’ end of one exon with the 5’ end of the next exon and cuts out the intervening intron.
        The product is the end-to-end spliced exons and a segment of removed RNA that was the intron
        in the shape of a lariat. The figure above illustrates the process. After
        completion of the splicing, the mature mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it
        is used in protein synthesis (Translation). Introns do not exist in prokaryotes.
