In this module we’ve taken a broad look at some of the impacts of human beings on
                    the Earth’s ecosystems and communities. We began with an organizing framework
                    for understanding and predicting impacts. All else being equal, human impacts
                    will increase as populations get bigger, increase with greater affluence and a
                    higher standard of living, and will depend upon the types of technologies that
                    are used to support that standard of living.
