 While the monosaccharides can serve directly as sources of energy, as will be seen
			elsewhere in the course, they are also the building blocks for many molecules that are
			used for structure, energy storage and signaling. Here we will explore the process by
			which simple carbohydrates are linked together using a condensation reaction. Time will
			be spent on understanding this reaction since it is the same reaction that is used to
			link amino acids together to make proteins and fatty acids to glycerol to made the components of biological membranes.
