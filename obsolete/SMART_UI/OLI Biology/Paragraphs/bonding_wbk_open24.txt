 Previously, water was described as having a high dielectric constant. This
					property that is a measure of the polarity of the covalent bond within the
					molecule accounts for the separation of ions by polar molecules such as water.
					The force of attraction between two oppositely charged ions is inversely
					proportional to the dielectric constant. Thus water with a high dielectric
					constant decreases the attraction between opposite charges. This is physically
					explained by the ability of polar solvents to form ordered hydration layers
					around ions.
