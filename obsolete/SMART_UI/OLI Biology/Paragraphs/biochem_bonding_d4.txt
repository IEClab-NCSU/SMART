Due to the uneven charge distribution, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen is a
					polar covalent bond. In water, the partially positive hydrogen is attracted to
					the partially negative oxygen of another water molecule; this attraction is
					called a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for many of the unique
					properties of water.
