The numbering of the positions on the sugar furanose rings of DNA and RNA follow a
          convention that uses ' (prime) to denote the sugar positions. Thus the ribose has X
          connected to the 1' position and hydroxyl groups on the 2', 3' and 5' positions. Using
          this nomenclature, deoxyribose is formally called 2'-deoxyribose (2 prime deoxyribose) to
          denote the loss of the hydroxyl at the 2' position of ribose.
