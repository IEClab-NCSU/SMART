Metabolic
				pathways constitute a complex network of chemical reactions, with some
			pathways functioning like central “freeways” to which many other pathways connect.
			Pathways related to the harvesting of energy (chemical or solar) and biosynthesis of the
			major cellular components are conserved in many types of cells and organisms.
