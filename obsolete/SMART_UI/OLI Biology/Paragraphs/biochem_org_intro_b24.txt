There are many different types of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic
					acids. Each has a different function and purpose in living organisms. There are
					also many different types of subunit amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, and
					nucleotides. The combination of these different types of subunits is what
					determines the properties and function of the macromolecule. For example, the
					function of a particular protein is determined by the amino acids in it.
