Physical disturbance. Humans reshape the physical
                        structure of ecosystems by clearing forests, suppressing or setting fires,
                        building roads and cities, mining, maintaining croplands, and building water
                        control structures such as dams. This leads to biodiversity loss. It may
                        also increase our exposure to forest fires, floods, droughts, soil erosion,
                        landslides, and other physical hazards.

Resource depletion. Currently, the average citizen of
                        a developed nation consumes an average of 16 tons of minerals, ores, fossil
                        fuels, and biomass per year. Shortages may result if humans use resources at
                        an unsustainable rate. Wild plants and animals may be harvested to the point
                        of extinction. Degradation of soil can lead to crop failures. Minerals and
                        fossil fuels may be depleted to the point where their extraction becomes
                        increasingly expensive and disruptive.



Pollution. Humans release materials that harm
                        biodiversity or human health. Pollution may occur whenhumans greatly
                        increase the levels of naturally occurring materials in the air, water, or
                        soil. Other pollutants are novel synthetic chemical compounds, usually
                        derived from petrochemicals, that are toxic and persist in the
                        environment.
