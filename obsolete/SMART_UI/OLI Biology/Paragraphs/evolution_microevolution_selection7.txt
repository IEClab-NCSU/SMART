Use this information to predict how the average tail length within a
						population of mice will change in the following scenarios. You are starting
						with a population of whitefooted mice living in an old forest. The average
						mouse has a medium-long tail, but there are a range of tail lengths in the
						population (there is heritable variation). Note also that mice have short
						gestation times (23-28 days) and mouse pups are weaned in about 28 days, so
						the generation time for mice is very short. Female mice can have
						approximately 6 litters a year.
