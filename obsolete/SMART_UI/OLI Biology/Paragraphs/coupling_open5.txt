Direct coupling In this case a large negative 

Go for the reaction is created by directly coupling the unfavorable
        reaction to a favorable one on the same enzyme. For example, the phosphorylation of glucose
        is very unfavorable if inorganic phosphate is used as the source of phosphate. The standard
        energy change of +14 kJ/mol makes the Gibbs energy positive. However, if the unfavorable
        reaction is coupled to the conversion of ATP to ADP within the active site of the enzyme
        hexose kinase the 30 kJ of energy released from ATP can be utilized to reduce the standard
        energy change such that the overall Gibbs free energy becomes negative. The overall reaction
        is the transfer of phosphate from ATP to glucose, with an overall standard energy change of
        approximately -15 kJ/mol. 
Direct coupling: Reaction 1 and 2 are hypothetical half-reactions that sum to
            give the complete reaction at the bottom of the image. In the actual reaction the enzyme
            glucose kinase transfers the phospate group directly from ATP to glucose; hydrolysis of
            the ATP does not occur. Note that the two half-reactions sum to give the complete
            reaction, both in terms of the compounds involved as well as the overall standard energy
            change.


Indirect coupling. The Gibbs free energy can also become negative by either
        having a favorable reaction that preceeds the unfavorable one, or a favorable reaction that
        follows the unfavorable one. In the first case, the favorable preceeding reaction causes the
        concentration of the substrates for the following unfavorable reaction to be higher than
        equilibrium, making 

G negative. For the case of a favorable following reaction, the concentration of
        the products of the unfavorable reaction are kept to a level that is smaller than the
        equilibrium concentration, again making 

G negative. This type of coupling between reactions is referred to as indirect
        coupling because the coupling between favorable and unfavorable reactions occurs indirectly,
        via alteration of concentrations of reactants and products. 
Indirect coupling: In the absence of coupling (left) the conversion of [B] to [C]
            is uphill energetically, and therefore not favorable. If the preceeding step ([A] to
            [B]) is very favorable, the concentration of [B] increases to a level above its
            equilibrium level, which decreases the Gibbs free energy for step [B] to [C].
            Alternatively, if the following step ([C] to [D]) is favorable, the concentration of [C]
            will be lower than its equilbrium level, which also decreases the Gibbs free energy for
            the step [B] to [C].
