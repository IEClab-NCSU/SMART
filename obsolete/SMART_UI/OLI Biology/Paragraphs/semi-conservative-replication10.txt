As with any enzyme, DNA polymerase has a very specific set of requirements for
            recognition of its substrate. For DNA polymerase the substrate is single stranded
              DNA not double stranded DNA. Thus DNA polymerase is not able to bind to or
            recognize an intact genome but
            rather it uses each single strand of DNA as a template. 
While DNA polymerase requires single stranded DNA as a template, it does not have the
            ability to start anywhere on the strand and initiate de novo synthesis. The active site of the polymerase
            requires a segment of DNA or RNA bound in a complimentary manner to the single stranded
            template as an initiation point for the synthesis reaction. This segment of DNA or RNA
            is generally referred to as the primer.
If you examine the structure of either DNA or RNA there are two places that a new
            deoxy-nucleotide can be added to extend the length of the complementary strand.
