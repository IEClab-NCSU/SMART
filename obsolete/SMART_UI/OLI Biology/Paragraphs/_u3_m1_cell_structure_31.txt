Eukaryotes comprise plant and animals, but also fungi (singular fungus, for example molds and mushrooms) as well as
				protists, a group of single-celled eukaryotes. One simplified but
			useful analogy of a cell is that of a factory. Just as in a factory, cells have walls, a
			planning center where the product blueprints are stored, a source of energy, an assembly
			line for production, packaging and shipping facilities, storage facilities etc. In this
			module we will explore the different components of the cells and examine their
			specialized functions.
