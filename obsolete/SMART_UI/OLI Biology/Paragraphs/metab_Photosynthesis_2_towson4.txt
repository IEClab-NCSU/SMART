What happens to light energy that is absorbed by a pigment? In keeping with the law of
			conservation of energy, this energy does not disappear. Instead, it excites electrons in
			the pigment, boosting them to higher energy levels. In plants, the excited electrons
			from some pigments are transferred to other molecules, where they start the
			transformation of light energy into chemical potential energy.
