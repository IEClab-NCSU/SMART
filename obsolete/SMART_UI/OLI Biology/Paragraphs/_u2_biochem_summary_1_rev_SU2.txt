When atoms interact, they may share electrons. This allows the atoms to connect,
                    or form covalent
                        chemical bonds. It is the ability of the atom to form chemical bonds
                    with other atoms that enables the incredible diversity in forms of matter that
                    you see around you. Ions of opposite charge can interact by electrostatic
                    forces, making ionic bonds. In addition to ionic and covalent bonds, a particularly important
                    chemical interaction found in biological systems is the hydrogen
                    bond.
