The equilibrium constant, Ka, is a property of the molecule and its
					environment. The chemical nature of the molecule has the largest effect on
						Ka. Secondary to this, the environment of the group can shift the
						Ka. Therefore, every acidic group has its own Ka value.
					For the purposes of this course, we will use the approximation that Ka
					is the same for all molecules with the same functional group. The table below lists the
						Ka values for several acids.
