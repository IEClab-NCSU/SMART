O2 is a product of photosynthesis. This product is essential for many living
			organisms, including humans and any other organisms that go through cellular
			respiration. When photosynthesis became widespread in the early Earth’s oceans, it
			generated excess oxygen gas that changed the Earth’s atmosphere. This increase in
			atmospheric oxygen concentration eventually changed the face of our planet as organisms
			that couldn’t adapt died off and new organisms evolved.
