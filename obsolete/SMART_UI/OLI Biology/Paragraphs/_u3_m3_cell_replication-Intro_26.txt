Both mitosis and meiosis must keep track of the chromatids on a
			chromosome. In the Meiosis module, you will learn that meiosis
			must also keep track of homologous chromosomes. A diploid cell has two copies of each
			chromosome — one copy from each parent. These chromosome pairs are called
				homologous because they have the same genes, but may have different
			versions of that gene. For example, a homologous pair of chromosomes may have a gene for
			hair color. One chromosome in this homologue may contain a “blond” version of that gene
			and the other homologue may contain the “brown” version. Each gamete that is produced
			will get either the homologue with the brown version or the homologue with the blond
			version.
