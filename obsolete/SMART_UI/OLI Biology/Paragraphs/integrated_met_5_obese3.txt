Fatty acids can also be synthesized from acetyl-CoA by an energy requiring process.  As with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis many of the same enzymes are utilized in both pathways.  However, highly exergonic reactions in the degradative pathway are accomplished by a different mechanism in the synthetic pathway.
