Recall that in a covalent bond, the electrons are shared between two atoms.
					However, the two atoms donâ€™t necessarily share the electrons equally. Some atoms
					are more likely to draw the shared electrons closer to themselves. These atoms
					have a high 
						electronegativity. Both oxygen and nitrogen are molecules with a high
					electronegativity.
