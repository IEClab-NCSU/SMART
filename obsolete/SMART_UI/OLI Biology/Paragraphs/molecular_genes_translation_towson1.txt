The goal of translation is to make proteins. The sequence of amino acids in a
					protein is specified (or encoded) by the sequence of bases in the nucleic acid.
					You will recall that originally, the information is stored in DNA, but during
					transcription, an RNA copy of DNA is made. RNA molecules that contain
					instructions for making a protein are called messenger RNA
						(mRNA). The sequence of bases in the mRNA determines which amino acid
					will be used in the protein. Every three bases encode for a single amino acid.
					These three bases are called codons or triplets.
