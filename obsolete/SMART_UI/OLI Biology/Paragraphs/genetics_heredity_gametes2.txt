This cell contains a pair of homologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes
                        are two chromosomes with the same genes, but which often have different
                        alleles. In our example, we have highlighted a gene. Notice that one of the
                        chromosomes has the "A" version (or allele) of this gene and the other has
                        the "a" allele of this gene.
