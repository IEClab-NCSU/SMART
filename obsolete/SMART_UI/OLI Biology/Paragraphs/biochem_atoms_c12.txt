 The first key characteristic that truly identifies an element is its
						atomic number which is the number of protons in each atom. The
					atomic number is constant and identical for all atoms of an element. For
					example, hydrogen (H) atoms always have only one proton and have an atomic
					number of one. If an atom has two protons, it has an atomic number of two, and
					it is helium (He). For this reason, if you started with one hydrogen atom and
					added a proton, the original hydrogen would now be helium. If an atom has three
					protons in its nucleus, it is a lithium (Li) atom. Beryllium (Be) has four
					protons in its nucleus, and so on. Based on their atomic numbers, elements can
					be organized into a periodic table of elements like the one pictured below. The
					number at the top of each box in the table is the atomic number of
					the element.
