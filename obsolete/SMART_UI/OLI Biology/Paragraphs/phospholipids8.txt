 Phospholipids contain only two fatty acids attached to a glycerol head.
							This occurs by a condensation reaction similar to the one discussed
							above. The third alcohol of the glycerol forms an ester bond through
							reaction with phosphoric acid. This is another example of a condensation
							reaction between an acid and an alcohol with the release of water. As a
							triprotic acid (i.e it has three acidic functions on the phorphorus
							atom) the phosphate group attached to the glycerol has the potential to
							form ester links with a variety of other molecules such as
							carbohydrates, choline, inositol and amino acids. The phosphate group
							along with the glycerol group make the head of the phospholipid
							hydrophilic, whereas the fatty acid tail is hydrophobic. Thus
							phospholipids are amphipathic:a molecule with a polar end and a
							hydrophobic end. When phospholipids are in an aqueous solution they will
							self assemble into micelles or bilayers, structures that exclude water
							molecules from the hydrophobic tails while keeping the hydrophilic head
							in contact with the aqueous solution. View the animation that
							demonstrates the formation of micelles and bilayers.
