In some cases it is necessary to move molecules against a gradient. The eukaryotc cell, a
			typical mammalian cell, has many compartments within the cell each surrounded by a lipid
			bilayer membrane. In most cases the environment within the compartment is different than
			that in the cytoplasm. An example is the lysosome, a degradative organelle (membrane
			bound compartment within the cell) whose function is to digest macromolecules delivered either from the outside of the cell or from other compartments within the cell. To
			carry out this function the lysosome maintains a much lower pH inside the lysosome
			relative to the cytoplasm. At equilibrium, the concentration of protons would be equal on
			both the inside and outside of the lysosome.
