Every cell needs to take in nutrients and get rid of waste products. This is accomplished
            via processes that exchange molecules across the cell membrane. For a single-celled
            organism, this is accomplished through direct exchange with the environment. It gets
            more complicated with larger organisms where cells are not in direct contact with the
            “outside” environment. In such organisms, including humans, there are specialized organ
            systems that serve as interfaces with the environment, moving things into, and out of,
            the body to keep it functioning. The two major organ systems that serve to exchange
            nutrients and waste with the environment are the digestive system (food and
            feces) and respiratory system (oxygen and carbon dioxide).
