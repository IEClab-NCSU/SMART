You are dependent on and participate in a global ecosystem. As a consumer you depend on
					producers for food energy. If you eat producers directly and live on trophic
					level 2, your overall requirements for productive land, water, fertilizer, and
					other inputs are relatively low. If you eat a lot of animal products that are
					fed grain, your requirements are greater. In any case, you participate in
					activities that influence chemical cycling on a global scale. You will learn
					more about human activities and their environmental impacts in the next
					module.
