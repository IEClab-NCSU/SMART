By convention, the sequences of peptides and proteins are written with the
					N-terminus on the left and the C-terminus on the right. The name of the
					N-terminal residue is always the first amino acid. The name of each amino acid
					then follows. The primary sequence of a protein refers to its amino
					acid sequence.
