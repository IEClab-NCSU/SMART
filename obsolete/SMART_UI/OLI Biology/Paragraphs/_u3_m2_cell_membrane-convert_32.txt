As three different molecules move, they encounter the lipid bilayer depicted by
					the horizontal membrane across the center of the stage in the preceding
					animation. Note that one type of molecule passes freely through the lipid
					bilayer while the second type of molecule only occasionally passes through the
					membrane and the lipid bilayer is totally impermeable to the third type of
					molecule.
