 Because DNA polymerase will generally denature and irreversibly inactivate at these
          elevated temperatures it is necessary to add fresh DNA polymerase at each cycle when the
          temperature is lowered during primer attachment. To avoid repetitive addition of a very
          expensive enzyme after each cycle and to make automation of the process feasible, there
          was an advantage to finding a DNA polymerase that survives high temperatures and in fact
          is active at high temperatures. Such an enzyme was found from thermophilic bacteria
          (bacteria that thrive at extremely high temperatures). One such enzyme, taq DNA polymerase
          from thermos aquaticus, is optimally active around 75 degrees and can withstand
          temperatures as high as 100 degrees without denaturing. Thus the PCR reaction can be
          performed in a closed tube with DNA to be amplified, taq DNA polymerase, excess dNTPs, and
          excess amounts of the forward and reverse primers. The reaction tube is put in an
          instrument called a thermocycler that can be programmed to automatically raise and lower
          the reaction temperature. Now the temperature is raised to form single stranded DNA,
          lowered to bind the primers and DNA polymerase with the correct substrate again replicates
          the DNA. After 20 cycles of this process with each cycle doubling the number of duplex DNA
          strands present, there will be 1, 048,576 copies of the DNA present.
