Unfortunately, as many individuals age, their ability to produce lactase is
                    diminished. This is especially true for individuals from Asian, African, Native
                    American, or Mediterranean descent. The incidence of lactose intolerance is
                    lower for those of European descent. Approximately one in seven American adults
                    suffer from lactose intolerance, and African Americans can show signs of lactose
                    intolerance as early as two years of age.
