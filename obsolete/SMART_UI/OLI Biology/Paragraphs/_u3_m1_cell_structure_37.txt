The cytoskeleton is formed by a series of protein filaments, and is both a
			scaffold for the cell structure and a framework for many activities from cell movement
			to cell division. Among the protein filaments that form the cytoskeleton,
				actin has a prominent role in cell movement, maintaining cell shape and
			connection to other cells, as well as intracellular transport. A barrel-shaped structure
			only present in animal cells is the centriole, which plays a role in the
			spatial organization of the cell and cell division. Centrioles are formed by
				microtubules, another filament type of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules
			form also appendages such as the flagellum of the sperm cell and the
				cilia of the cells of the respiratory system.
