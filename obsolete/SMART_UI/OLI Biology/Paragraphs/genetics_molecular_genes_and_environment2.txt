How does environment exert its influence on phenotype? Recall that at the molecular and
            cellular levels, phenotype depends on the molecules produced by the cell. Production of
            all molecules is catalyzed by protein enzymes that are encoded by the genome of the
            organism. Ultimately, if phenotype depends on protein function, then the environment
            must have a way of modifying the amount and the activity of proteins. Using the central
            dogma of molecular biology, we can deduce that environment may affect protein function
            at the level of protein, mRNA, or DNA.
