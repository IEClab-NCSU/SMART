Changes in species distributions. Many species’ geographic
                    ranges are shifting, following climate conditions toward historically cooler
                    areas as their existing habitats get warmer. Species are shifting toward the
                    poles: further north in the Northern Hemisphere and further south in the
                    Southern Hemisphere. In mountainous regions, species’ distributions are shifting
                    upward to higher elevations. Range shifts may lead to endangerment of species,
                    loss of species that provide economic resources, and northward spread of
                    tropical pathogens and their vectors (particularly mosquitoes).
