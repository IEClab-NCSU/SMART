Growing from a single fertilized egg to an adult organism requires many rounds of
						cell division. Before cell division, a cell must copy its genome so
					that each new daughter cell receives a full set of DNA. This DNA

						cell
						cycle just prior to mitosis. The process of mitosis
					sorts the DNA equally into two separate nuclei. The process of mitosis is
					divided into the following steps or phases:
