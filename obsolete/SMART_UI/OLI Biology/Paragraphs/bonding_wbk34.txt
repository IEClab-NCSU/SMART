 Each of the bond types represents a measurable amount of energy. To break a
					bond, the equivalent amount of energy must be expended. In metabolism, bonds are
					broken in molecules, such as glucose, to "release" the energy. The cell utilizes
					this energy to drive other energy consuming reactions. The covalent bond has the
					most energy associated with it, on average approximately 100 kilocalories/mole
					(kcal/mol). The non-covalent bonds, ionic and hydrogen, and hydrophobic
					interactions, have approximately 5 kcals/mol associated with each of them.
