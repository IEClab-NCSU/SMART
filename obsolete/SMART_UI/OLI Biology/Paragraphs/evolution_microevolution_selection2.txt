Working independently of one another in the 1850s, Charles Darwin and Alfred
					Wallace were the first scientists to posit the theory of evolution by natural
					selection. Ideas about evolution had been proposed before, but Darwin and
					Wallace added a crucial element to the theory: they provided a mechanism for how
					evolution could work.
