The energy stored in chemical bonds. Chemical energy can be released
                                when certain bonds are broken. Chemical energy is released when wood
                                is burned: the bonds in the wood are broken, releasing light and
                                heat energy. Chemical energy stored in ATP is used to run many
                                cellular processes. Chemical energy stored in foods is used to build
                                ATP.
