Speciation is the formation of new biological lineages. It occurs
            when an existing species splits or branches into two or more new species that evolve
            independently of each other. Over very long periods of time, repeated branching of a
            lineage can create groups of related species called clades. A
            clade is a complete group of all species that descend from some common ancestor. The six
            species of Spoonbill form a clade; all of them share unique adaptive traits not found in
            other birds, most notably the distinctive bill. They all likely descended from a single
            ancestral species that possessed these unique features.
