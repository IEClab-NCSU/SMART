An ion is an atom or a molecule that carries a charge. Negatively charged ions, 
                        called anions, form when a neutral molecule or atom gains one or more electrons.  
                        Positively charged ions, called cations, form when a neutral molecule or atom looses one 
                        or more electrons.
