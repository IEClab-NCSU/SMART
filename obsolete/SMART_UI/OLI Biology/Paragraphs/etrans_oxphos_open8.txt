The electrons from FADH2 are first processed by complex II. Complex
          II is actually succinate dehydrogenase from the TCA cycle. The electron acceptor for
          succinate, FAD, is tightly bound to the enzyme. Consequently, it is more correct to
          consider that complex II processes the electrons from succinate, first passing them to FAD
          and then via iron-sulfur centers to coenzyme Q. The two electrons then follow the same
          path as those from NADH2, from coenzyme Q to complex III, and then to complex
          IV via cytochrome C, finally to oxygen to produce water. Since electron transport through
          complex II does not result in the transport of protons only a total of 6 protons/2
          electrons are transported across the inner membrane when succinate is the initial electron
          donor.
