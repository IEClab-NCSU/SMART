        In the previous module you learned about a limited set of functional groups on molecules found in 
        biological systems and some of their properties. Specifically you learned there were only three 
        types of functional groups: non-polar, polar neutral, and polar charged. Within these types there 
        are eight that are particularly relevant to biological systems out of the hundreds of known 
        organic functional groups. 
			
			
		Of the three types, the polar charged groups, amino, carboxyl, and phosphate, undergo the
		greatest change depending on the environment in which they are found. They are weak electrolytes 
		and behave as bases (amino groups) or acids (carboxyl and phosphate groups) and as such have 
		the potential to exist as ions. In this module you will explore the properties of weak acids 
		and bases including their dissociation equilibrium and their ability to act as pH buffers. The 
		cell exploits these properties to control intracellular pH, the ionic state of molecules and
		the activity level of molecules. Thus we need to have a thorough understanding of the chemical 
		behavior of acids and bases in solution. In the final module of this unit you will see these 
		concepts in action in protein ligand binding.
