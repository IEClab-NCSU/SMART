The concentration of hydrogen ions in solution can have important effects on
                    biological systems. Changes in the hydrogen ion concentration in your body can
                    result in disease and even death. Changes in the hydrogen ion concentration of
                    the oceans can have dramatic impacts on life in the sea, affecting all levels of
                    the food chain. Even something as simple as soil pH can affect the kinds of
                    plants that can live in an area.
