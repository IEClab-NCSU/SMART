The word evolution means change, and
			things that change are said to "evolve." These terms are commonly used in our everyday
			lives (a work project evolves from the original idea to a finished product, people
			dealing with a tragedy evolve as they learn to cope), but in these settings they have a
			very different meaning than in biology. In biology, the words evolution and evolve are used in a precise way. These
			words apply to changes that occur in the gene pool of a population. Evolution occurs in
			populations, not in individual organisms. In biological terms, for example, individual
			people don't evolve, but the human race does. When evolution occurs in a population,
			different alleles (and genotypes) become more or less frequent within the gene pool. As
			a result, we observe a gradual change in the inherited characteristics of the population
			as one generation succeeds another.
