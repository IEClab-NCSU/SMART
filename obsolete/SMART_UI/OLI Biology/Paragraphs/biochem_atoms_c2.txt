In addition to providing information about each elementâ€™s atomic number, most
					periodic tables also provide an atomic mass for each element. The atomic mass, also
					known as the atomic weight,
					(the mass of the nucleus) is the sum of the number of protons and the number of
					neutrons. A hydrogen atom that has 1 proton and 1 neutron would have an atomic
					mass of 2. A carbon atom which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons has an atomic mass
					of 12.
