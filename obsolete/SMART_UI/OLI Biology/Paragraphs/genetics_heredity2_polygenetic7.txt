Many single genes can have numerous different effects, rather than just
                            two. This capability is called pleiotropy. In the 1930s, for
                            instance, researchers found a gene in chickens that leads most obviously
                            to feathers that curl out, but that also (and less visibly) leads to
                            increased metabolism, blood flow, body temperature, and digestive
                            capacity, as well as fewer eggs laid. This pleiotropic gene is called
                            the “frizzle” gene because of its effect on the appearance of the
                            chickens.
