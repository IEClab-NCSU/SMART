The interaction between a polar bond on water and polar bonds on hydrophilic
					molecules is given a special name â€” the hydrogen bond, because it involves a
					hydrogen that forms a bridge between the two molecules. Hydrogen bonds are
					fairly stable, so quite a bit of energy is released when they are formed. The
					release of energy helps hydrophilic molecules like glucose dissolve in water.
					Since hydrophilic molecules contain polar bonds, they are often referred to as
							polar molecules.
