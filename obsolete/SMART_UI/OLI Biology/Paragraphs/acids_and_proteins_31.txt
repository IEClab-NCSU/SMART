The biological function of most proteins involves binding to something else. The binding
			event may be the first step in transport, signaling, regulation, or an enzyme-catalyzed
			reaction. Molecules that bind to proteins without being modified are called
				ligands. Although ligands are usually small molecules, they can also be
			larger than the protein to which they are binding. For example, when proteins bind to
			DNA, it is the DNA that is the ligand. Oxygen is a ligand when it binds to hemoglobin (a
			protein) during oxygen transport to the tissues. Molecules found on the surface of
			bacterial cells are ligands when antibodies (proteins) in your blood bind to them during
			an immune response. Sometimes ligands are given special names to remind us of their
			function. For example: enzyme inhibitors are ligands that bind to and inhibit enzymes;
			antigens are ligands that are recognized by antibodies (which are proteins).
