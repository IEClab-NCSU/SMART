Cholesterol is an example of a familiar steroid that plays many important roles in your
			body. While most people are familiar with cholesterol, they often donâ€™t realize how
			important it is for healthy function. In fact, most of the cholesterol in your body is
			synthesized by your liver. Cholesterol has many functions. Cholesterol is used to build
			steroid hormones, including testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the sex
			organs. Cholesterol is also the precursor to vitamins D and K. Some cholesterol is
			converted to bile salts, which help in the absorption of fats from the digestive system
			into the body. Cholesterol is also used by animals to maintain the proper consistency of
			the cell membrane, which is the structure that surrounds every cell. Other organisms use
			different steroids for this function. For example, plants use a steroid called
			stigmasterol, while fungi use ergosterol.
