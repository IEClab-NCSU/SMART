By losing an electron, sodium becomes a cation with a positive charge (+1). By gaining an
			electron, chlorine becomes an anion with a negative charge (-1). Now each ion has a net
			charge and the two charges are opposite. The ions attract one another. The electrostatic
			interaction between the sodium ion and the chlorine ion is an ionic bond .
