The phosphorylation of enzymes during periods of glucose demand or the dephosphorylation of
      enzymes when there is surplus glucose results in the correct biological response of the liver
      cell. Phosphorylation results in the activation of enzymes that cause the release of glucose
      from glycogen and also results in the synthesis of new glucose by the anabolic pathway
      gluconeogenesis. Dephosphorylation of enzymes causes the activation of enzymes involved in the
      storage of glucose in glycogen and can also result in the activation of glucose oxidation for
      ATP production.
