Entry of carbohydrates into the TCA cycle occurs by the transport of pyruvate from the
          cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix. There, the pyruvate undergoes a process called
            oxidative decarboxylation to produce a key intermediate in metabolism,
            acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle.
