In real ecosystems, energy availability can be measured in many different ways.  The mass of organisms at each trophic level can be measured, or their total annual calorie requirements can be estimated.  In either case, the overall energy pyramid pattern remains quite consistent.  This helps to explain why huge hunting grounds support only small numbers of top-level predators such as killer whales, great white sharks, or tigers.
