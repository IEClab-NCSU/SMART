What is the difference between allele and mutation? Any change in
            the DNA of an organism is called a mutation. Mutations can be
            advantageous, harmful, or neutral (in which case they have no effect on the phenotype).
            Mutations include large deletions and rearrangements in the DNA, but they can also be
            changes in a single base. Mutation is a more general term than
                allele because mutation does not necessarily involve a
            specific gene, but can include deletion or rearrangement of multiple genes. Multiple
            alleles of a gene arise by mutation, and they will be passed on to the offspring and
            will persist in the population.
