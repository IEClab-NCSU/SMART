Each major class of organic molecules represents a diverse assortment of
							polymers that are built from a handful of possible
					monomers. The monomers, smaller molecules bound together,
					are also called subunits. The table below lists the subunits for each class of
					organic molecule. Different carbohydrates, for example, are polymers made up of
					sugars (the monomers). Proteins are polymers made up of amino acids (the
					monomers). Nucleic acids are polymers made up of nucleotides (subunits or
					monomers). Even lipids are generated by combining separate fatty acid chemical
					components.
