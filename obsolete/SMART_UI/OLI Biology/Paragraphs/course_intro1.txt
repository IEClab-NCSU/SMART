Welcome to the OLI version of Modern Biology. This introductory course is called "Modern
			Biology" because it is focused on topics at the forefront of experimentation in the
			fields of cellular biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics. It is carefully
			planned to provide the background students will need for advanced biology classes.
			Students from other disciplines may also find this course useful as it explains many of
			the concepts and techniques currently discussed in the popular press and applied in
			other contexts.
