Although this expression for the Gibbs free energy appears different than previous
          expressions, it is really the same equation. The "product" of the reaction is glucose
          inside the cell and the "reactant" is glucose outside the cell. The difference in standard
          free energy, 

Go, is zero because the reactants and products are the same compound,
          differing only in their location. If the concentration of glucose outside the cell is
          higher than the concentration inside the cell, then the Gibbs free energy is negative (the
          ln of a number less than one is negative) and glucose will spontaneously enter the cell.
          If the glucose concentration in both compartments are the same, then 

=0 and there is no net movement of glucose across the membrane. If the
          concentration of glucose inside the cell exceeds the concentration outside then 

>0 and the reverse reaction, the net movement of glucose out of the cell, will be
          spontaneous.
