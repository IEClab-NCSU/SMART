Meiosis is a process of reductive cell division that produces haploid (1N) cells
					from diploid (2N) cells. In animals, gametes are haploid reproductive cells that
					are produced using the process of meiosis. The gametes from two individuals fuse
					in the processes of fertilization to produce a diploid zygote. The diploid
					zygote divides using the process of mitosis to become an adult organism.
