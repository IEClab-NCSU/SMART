Although there are many competing priorities, environmental concerns have become
            more prominent in our society since the 1970s. Corporations have adopted
            environmental goals as part of their mission statements. Nonprofit groups
            advocate for the environment. Government programs promote specific environmental
            goals. We use buzzwords like “sustainability” and “stewardship.” Products and
            ideas are marketed as being “ecosafe,” “earth-friendly,” or “green.”
