Like any polymer, nucleic acids are made up of repeating subunits or monomers.
					The subunits of nucleic acids are called nucleotides.
					Each nucleotide contains three building blocks: a phosphate,
					a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The
						nitrogenous base is a type of organic
						molecule that consists of one or two ring structures. Note that the
					term “base” is used here to refer to a specific part of the nucleic
					acid structure; the meaning is very different from the use of the term “base” in
					the discussion of pH and 	acid-base chemistry.
