Different kinds of biologists study different things. Cell biologists are currently
			researching the causes and symptoms of various types of cancer, enabling doctors to find
			cures and treatments. Ecologists are biologists who specialize in studying the way that
			living organisms interact with their environments. They examine important issues such as
			acid rain and observe what happens to the health of living systems when acid rain falls.
			There are even specialized biologists, called astrobiologists, who study conditions on
			other planets and design experiments to determine whether or not life could exist in
			other places in our solar system.
