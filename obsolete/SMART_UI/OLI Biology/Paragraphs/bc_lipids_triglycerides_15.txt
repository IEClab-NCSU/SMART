Saturated fats have three saturated fatty acid “tails” — all of which are linear
					in shape. With their compact shape, saturated fat molecules pack together
					efficiently and form a solid at room temperature. These are usually produced by
					animals; everyday examples of saturated fats include lard and real butter.
					Unsaturated fats have at least one unsaturated fatty acid. With their “kinky”
					fatty acid(s), unsaturated fats will not pack into a regular structure and thus
					remain fluid at room temperature. They are called oils, and are commonly
					produced by plants; everyday examples include olive oil, corn oil, and canola
					oil.
