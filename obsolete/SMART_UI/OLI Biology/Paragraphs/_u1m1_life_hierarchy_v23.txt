Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can
					be examined on a scale from small to large. In this course, the smallest level
					we will examine is the atom, which is the basic unit of matter. The atom consists of a
					dense nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms join together to form molecules. A
						molecule is a
					chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a chemical
					bond. Macromolecules are biologically important molecules, and they are
					technically polymers. Polymers are made by combining smaller units called
					monomers, which are simpler macromolecules. An example of a macromolecule is the
					genetic molecule deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains the instructions for
					the development of all living organisms. DNA is built of four kinds of monomers
					(nucleotides). They are strung together, or polymerized, in a sequence that
					codes for the structure of proteins and other biological molecules. The DNA in
					one of your microscopic cells contains a sequence of almost three billion
					nucleotides.
