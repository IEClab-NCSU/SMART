A cellular structure consisting of RNA and protein organized into two
                                subunits and functioning as the site of protein synthesis in the
                                cytoplasm. The ribosomal subunits are constructed in the nucleolus.
                                In prokaryotes ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm; however, in
                                eukaryotes they are mainy associated with part of the endoplasmic
                                reticulum, named rough endoplasmic reticulum -- due to its dotted
                                appearance.
