The electrical charge of an atom governs its behavior when it comes into contact
					with another atom; that is, how the atom reacts with other atoms. Atoms with
					unlike charges (+/-) will attract each other and connect, binding to form a
					molecule. Atoms with like charges repel each other. That means two atoms both
					positively charged (+/+) or both negatively charged (-/-) will resist or reject
					contact. The changes in the atomic composition of a substance that occur as a
					result of the attraction or repulsion of two or more atoms is called a
						chemical reaction. A chemical reactions produce one or more products 
					resulting from a chemical change that transforms a set of molecules.
