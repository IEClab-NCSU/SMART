 The hydrophobic effect does not involve direct bonding between the non-polar
					molecules, it is an entropy driven process. You may recall that processes that
					increase the disorder of a system are more favorable. When a hydrophobic
					molecule is truly dissolved in water, the water forms a highly ordered ice-like
					shell around the compound. When the hydrophobic molecules contact each during
					separation of the aqueous and non-polar phases, the ordered water is released
					and become highly disordered. The increase in disorder of the released water
					molecules is responsible for the spontaneous assembly of many biological
					systems, such as proteins and membranes.
