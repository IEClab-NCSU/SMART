In this module we will cover briefly the currently accepted hypothesis of how cells
			evolved and discuss the pillars of the cell theory. We will explore the
			different types of cells, and learn about their structures and functions. You will be
			able to relate structural characteristics of the biomolecules studied before with the
			structure and functions of the parts of the cell. While all cells have similar
			structures, there are differences between the more ancient prokaryotic and
			the more recent eukaryotic cells. Also, there are structures that are only
			present in plant or animal cells. In multicellular organisms the specialization of cells
			is striking, in both structure and function.
