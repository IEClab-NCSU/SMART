 Each atom in a molecule will complete its outer shell of electrons,
							which is 2 for hydrogen, and 8 for second row elements (e.g. C, N and
							O). The valence shells for each of the biologically relevant elements
							are highlighted in the periodic table below. The relationship between
							the number of unpaired electrons in the valence shell and the number of
							possible covalent bonds an element can form is given in the Atomic
								Properties TABLE above.
