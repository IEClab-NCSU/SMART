Until now, we have focused on specific populations responding to limiting factors such as
			weather, crowding, or fishing by humans. Community ecology broadens the focus to explore
			how populations of different species interact with each other. An ecological community is the collection of all interacting species populations
			within some defined area. Because animals move in and out of any given area, it can be
			tricky to determine what populations belong within a community. For example, birds such
			as herons may interact with pond communities by removing fish. They are therefore
			included as part of the pond community because they can have an important effect on pond
			life.
