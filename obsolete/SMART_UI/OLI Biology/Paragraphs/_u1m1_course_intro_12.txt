The diagram above represents the "Big Picture" of biology. It illustrates how the course
			is organized and depicts the relationships between the main topics you will learn about
			as you progress through the material. You will find that as you go, the material is
			telling a story. It is a story based on the research and collaboration of centuries of
			scientific thinkers. The story begins with the smallest particles of matter: atoms.
			Atoms are the building blocks of all matter and they can be put together, like Legos, to
			form molecules. A special class of molecules called biomolecules are the “legos” used to
			build the structures required for life. The fundamental unit of life is the cell, and
			all cells are made of biomolecules. The cell is the first level of organization to
			display all the characteristics of life. Cells, and all living organisms, require energy
			to function. Organisms capture and use energy through a chain of chemical reactions
			called metabolic processes. The energy that cells capture through metabolism can be used
			to do work, including the work required for reproduction. All living organisms
			reproduce, passing their genetic information from generation to generation. This results
			in a unity and diversity of all living organisms, because we all share a common
			ancestor. Some organisms are more likely to survive than others, and this leads to
			evolutionary processes that result in the incredible diversity of life you see around
			you. The final chapter in the story reminds us that the diversity of life exists within
			a rich context of interactions, causes, and effects. Life does not take place in a
			vacuum; instead, living organisms rely intimately on other living organisms, as well as
			in the nonliving environment. All matter, living and nonliving, exists within a delicate
			interconnected balance, and humans are just one part of this biosphere.
