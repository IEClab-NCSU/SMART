The cell is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and
					function in life: it is the smallest and simplest entity that is truly alive.
					Some organisms consist of just one cell (they are unicellular), whereas others
					consist of many cells (we are multicellular). A cell is essentially a tiny
					droplet of fluid and molecules enclosed by a fluid “skin” or membrane. Organisms
					are classified as prokaryotes or eukaryotes. The cells of prokaryotes are
					relatively small and simple; they do not have any clearly defined compartments
					inside of them. The cells of eukaryotes, by contrast, include membrane-bound organelles: compartments inside the cell that contain
					specific groups of macromolecules and carry out specific cellular functions. One
					of these organelles is the nucleus; it encloses the DNA within the cell. The
					cell will be studied in more detail as the class progresses. You may want to preview
