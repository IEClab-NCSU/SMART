 While it is clear that many ketose structures are possible, only a few are used in
			biological systems and the focus for this course will be on the hexose D-fructose. The
fructose structure has the ketone group as at the number 2 carbon and the D
designation based on the chirality at carbon number 5. Applying the principle that compounds
			will spontaneously form stable ring structures, and using a mechanism
			similar to that employed for the aldoses, fructose will spontaneously form a five-member ring
			structure. These structures are depicted below and are in equilibrium with
			each other through the free ketone structure.
