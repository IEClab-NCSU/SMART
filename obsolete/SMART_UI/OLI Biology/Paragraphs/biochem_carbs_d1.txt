Indigestible carbohydrates, which cannot be degraded by human digestive enzymes, are referred
			to as dietary fiber. Cellulose, mentioned above as a major
			component of plant cell walls, is one of the largest contributors of dietary fiber.
			Pectin is another structural carbohydrate found in most plants, especially apples and
			citrus fruits, and is commonly used as a gelling agent to make jams and jellies. A diet
			high in fiber has several benefits. Dietary fiber plays a role in maintaining regular
			digestive functioning, slowing the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, and
			reducing bad cholesterol. So the old saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” does
			have some truth to it, since there are proven health benefits associated with the
			consumption of foods that are high in fiber, like apples. Other foods that are high in
			fiber are oatmeal, popcorn, raspberries, black beans, lentils, and peas, to name a
			few.
