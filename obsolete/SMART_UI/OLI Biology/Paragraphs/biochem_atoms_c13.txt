In addition to providing information about each elementâ€™s atomic number,
					most periodic tables also provide an atomic mass for each element. The atomic mass, also
					known as the atomic weight, reports the mass of the nucleus. The mass of the
					nucleus is the sum of all protons and neutrons found in the nucleus. A hydrogen
					atom has one proton and would therefore have an atomic mass of one. A carbon
					atom, which has six protons and six neutrons, would have an atomic mass of 12.
