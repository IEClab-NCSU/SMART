Dehydrogenase. As the name suggests, enzymes of this group transfer hydrogen atoms
      from the substrate to an electron acceptor, such as NAD+ or FAD . Therefore they
      are redox enzymes since removal of hydrogen atoms is the equivalent to removal of electrons.
      The name is applied to both oxidation and reduction reactions.
