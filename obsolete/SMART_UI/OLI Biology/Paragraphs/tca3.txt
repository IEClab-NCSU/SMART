Entry of fatty acids into the TCA occurs directly into acetyl-CoA. During the
          process of fatty acid oxidation (beta-oxidation) which also occurs in the mitochondrial
          matrix, two-carbon fragments are progressively released from fatty acids and incorporated
          into acetyl-CoA.
