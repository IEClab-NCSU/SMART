a structural unit of a polymer. For example, glucose is a monomer that makes up polysaccharide starch, and amino acids are monomers (monomeric subunits) that make up proteins (aka polypeptides).  In biochemistry, monomer is also used to specify a protein that contains only one polypeptide.  In contrast, multimeric proteins may contain two (dimer), three (trimer), four (tetramer) or more polypeptide chains.
