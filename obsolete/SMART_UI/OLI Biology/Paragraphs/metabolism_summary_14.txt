To extract useful energy from sugar, cells rely on two major types of catabolic pathways:
			cellular respiration and fermentation. Cellular respiration involves the
				mitochondria and requires oxygen gas as an input. Fermentation
			does not require oxygen and occurs in the cytoplasm. In both of these pathways, some of
			the energy released by the breakdown of sugar molecules is captured in chemical bonds
			within ATP molecules.
