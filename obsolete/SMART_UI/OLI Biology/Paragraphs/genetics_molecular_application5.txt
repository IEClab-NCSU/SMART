A homicide has occurred, and you are trying to determine which of your suspects is
                most likely the culprit. You collect blood from the crime scene, the victim, and
                each suspect. You use PCR to amplify a region of tandem repeats in each DNA sample.
                If there are more tandem repeats present in a DNA molecule, then the PCR product
                will be larger. For instance, if Bob has seven repeats and Joe has only two, the PCR
                product from Bob’s DNA will be larger than the PCR product from Joe’s DNA. The PCR
                products are separated using a technique called gel electrophoresis. In this
                technique, DNA is placed in an electric field, and the DNA will move toward the
                positive electrode due to the negative charge on the DNA. The DNA is forced to move
                through a crosslinked gel material. Because smaller DNA molecules can move faster
                through the gel, this technique separates DNA molecules by size. The distance of the
                DNA from the top of the gel is directly related to the size of the DNA, and
                therefore the number of tandem repeat. An image of the gel is shown below.
