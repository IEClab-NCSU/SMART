 The enzyme consists of two separable subunits. The Fo subunit is within the
          membrane and is responsible for the transfer of protons through the membrane. The
            F1 subunit extends into the mitochondrial matrix and is responsible for the
          synthesis of ATP. The F1 subunit is composed of three 

 subunits and three 

 subunits. These six subunits from a spherical structure where the 

 and 

 subunits alternate. The 

 subunit extends from the Fo domain through the center of the 
-
 sphere. The 

 subunit rotates 120 degrees every time three protons flows through the
            Fo domain. The 
-
 sphere is prevented from rotating along with the 

 subunit by the b-subunit, which anchors the 
-
 sphere to the membrane.
