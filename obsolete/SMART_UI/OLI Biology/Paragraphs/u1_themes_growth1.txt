All organisms grow and develop. Growth is just an increase in size. In development, structure and function change in an
            orderly way as an organism passes through its life cycle. An individual’s pattern of
            development is partly determined by genetic instructions. DNA, the molecule of
            inheritance, encodes proteins and other molecules that build cells and make them work.
            You can think of genes as “recipes” for proteins. Each cell has a huge library of
            thousands of recipes in its DNA. But most of the recipes don’t get used in any given
            cell. Chemical controls tell the “cooks” whether to make a given protein, or ignore its
            recipe and make something else. Therefore, even though your cells share the same DNA,
            their activities change radically in different parts of your body and at different
            stages of development.
