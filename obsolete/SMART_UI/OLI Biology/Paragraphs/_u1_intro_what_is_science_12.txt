Biology is an example of a scientific field that deals with understanding living
                    organisms. Chemistry is a scientific field that deals with understanding atoms
                    and molecules. Overall, scientific fields can be broken down into two main
                    branches: natural sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. Social and
                    behavioral sciences focus on human cultures and the behaviors of humans in
                    groups and as individuals. Biology is a natural science that includes many
                    related sub-branches, such as ecology, biochemistry, and microbiology. Each
                    sub-branch of biology examines different aspects of living organisms. Other
                    natural sciences are physical sciences like chemistry and physics. It is
                    important to remember that even though scientific knowledge is broken into
                    branches and sub-branches of study, the knowledge gained from the various
                    scientific disciplines is interconnected. For instance, to understand how a cell
                    responds to a certain environmental signal, it is necessary to know about the
                    chemical composition of that signal, so the science of chemistry is important to
                    understand the science of biology. Likewise, understanding how the brain
                    functions (neuroscience) can aid in understanding the human behaviors studied in
                    the social and behavioral sciences.
