The dependence of the reaction velocity on the kinetics of substrate binding,
					substrate release, and conversion to product is difficult to calculate under all
					conditions. However, if steady-state conditions are assumed then a very
					simple relationship can be found. Steady-state conditions imply that during the
					measurement the concentrations of the various species, e.g. [ES] ,do not change.
					Under steady-state conditions the following equation describes the relationship
					between the measured rate (v) of the reaction and the initial concentration of substrate
					(S) and the concentration of the enzyme. This equation is the Michaelis
					Menton-Briggs Haldane equation.
