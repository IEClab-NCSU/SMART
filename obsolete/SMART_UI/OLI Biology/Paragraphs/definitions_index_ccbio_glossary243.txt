Forms of matter that an organism requires and that the organism
                                cannot make for itself. Nutrients must be taken in from the outside
                                environment. Humans obtain nutrients from the food we eat and the
                                water we drink. Plants take up nutrients through their roots (water
                                and dissolved minerals) and from the air (carbon dioxide gas).
