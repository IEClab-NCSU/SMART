In this module, you will learn about how biotechnology is used to produce human growth
            hormone (huGH) for medical applications. HuGH is a protein made of 191 amino acids. It
            is necessary for the normal growth and metabolism of an individual. Worldwide, one in
            4,000 to 10,000 individuals is born without the ability to make sufficient human growth
            hormone, causing a host of medical problems. These people can be helped with growth
            hormone injections, but growth hormone from other species (pigs, cattle) cannot be used.
            Only human growth hormone will produce the desired effects. Historically, the only
            source of human growth hormone was a small amount that could be extracted from recently
            deceased individuals (cadavers). this severely limited the supply that was available for
            medical use.
