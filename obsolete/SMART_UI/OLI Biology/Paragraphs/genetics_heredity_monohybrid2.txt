The table below represents a Punnett square — like the one seen on the
                        previous page — used to describe the results of Mendel’s first experimental
                        set of pea plants, designated F1. The gametes from the F1 generation, Bb,
                        are filled in at the top and on the sides. Fill in the center of the Punnett
                        square to see the possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes for the next
                        generation, F2.
