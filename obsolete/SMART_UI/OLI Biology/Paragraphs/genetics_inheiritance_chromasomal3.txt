This karyotype has an extra chromosome 21. This condition is called “trisomy 21” because
            the cell has three ("tri") of these chromosomes instead of the usual two. This condition
            is more commonly called “Down syndrome.” There are relatively few examples of such
            large-scale chromosomal anomalies. Down syndrome results from an extra copy of one of
            the smallest chromosomes. Extra or missing copies of sex chromosomes can also result in
            viable embryos. Embryos with extra or missing chromosomes are often nonviable, and other
            chromosomal anomalies are not generally seen.
