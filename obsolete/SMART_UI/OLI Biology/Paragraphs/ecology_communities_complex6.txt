Within kelp forests, human hunting revealed the importance of a keystone species. The
			story begins with urchins, which are abundant bottom-dwelling grazers and scavengers.
			Kelp are tough and fast-growing, but urchins (animals related tostarfish) can eat them
			with their hard rasp-like mouth parts. Urchins are protected by their prickly spines and
			a hard outer shell. In the absence of factors controlling their abundance, urchins can
			increase to very high densities, producing what are sometimes called “urchin barrens”
			devoid of kelp. Unlike kelp forests, urchin barrens do not support much life.
