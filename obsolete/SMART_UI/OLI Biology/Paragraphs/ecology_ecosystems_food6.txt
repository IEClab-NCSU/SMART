In the food chain above, the plant is the producer, the grasshopper is the primary
			consumer, the mouse the secondary consumer and the snake is the top predator or tertiary
			consumer. Food chains help us trace the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems.
			Based on the transfers shown above, plants are in trophic level 1, grasshoppers are in
			trophic level 2, mice are in level 3, and snakes are in level 4. Each level is dependent
			on the previous level as a source of food and may provide nutrients and energy to a
			subsequent level.
