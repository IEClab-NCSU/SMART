Human harvesting—hunting, fishing, logging, gathering, and so on—removes individuals more quickly than they can be replaced by natural reproduction.  This was historically a major threat in North America and Europe, but today most fish and wildlife resources are fairly well-protected.  Open ocean fisheries and tropical mammals, by contrast, are heavily impacted by human harvesting today.
