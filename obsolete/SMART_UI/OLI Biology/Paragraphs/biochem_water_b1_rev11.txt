The formation of the water cage is unfavorable, because it requires water
					molecules to become ordered. Ordering anything requires energy, whether it is a
					cage of water molecules surrounding a nonpolar molecule, or your messy dorm
					room. The energy cost of ordering water molecules around nonpolar compounds is
					so high that they are forced out of the water, leading to a separation of
					phases; oil and water donâ€™t mix because of the hydrophobic effect. Most
					biological molecules contain both polar and nonpolar regions. Their behavior in
					water depends on the relative number and type of polar groups versus nonpolar
					groups. For example, consider this series of simple alcohols.
