Good work. Youâ€™ve cracked the mystery! There is a situation called heterozygote advantage
			at work here. Why does a gene that alters red blood cells have anything to do with
			malaria? The malaria parasite spends a large part of its life cycle in red blood cells.
			The red blood cells of those with the Aa genotype are less
			hospitable to Plasmodium than those of an average (AA) individual. For example, in an Aa person
			the red blood cells may sickle in response to being invaded by Plasmodium. This will lead to the death of the newly invaded red blood cell,
			and the parasites will die with it.
