The two helical polynucleotide chains are coiled around a common axis
The phosphate and ribose groups are on the outside
The bases are directed toward the inside of the helix, and stack on the central helical axis.
The planes of the bases are perpendicular to the axis of the helix
The diameter of the helix is uniform and is 20 Angstroms
The bases are stacked and separated by a uniform distance of 3.4 Angstroms.
