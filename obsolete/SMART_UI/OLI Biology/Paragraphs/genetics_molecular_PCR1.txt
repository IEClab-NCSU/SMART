You may remember from the movie Jurassic Park how the DNA of a dinosaur was
                    recreated from a tiny amount of blood from a mosquito trapped in amber. While
                    (so far) this is not possible in real life, the idea is based on one of the most
                    useful tools for the manipulation of DNA: the polymerase chain
                    reaction, or PCR. This technique was invented by Kary Mullis in 1983. PCR
                    uses repeated cycles of DNA polymerase activity to amplify, or make many copies
                    of, a small segment of DNA known as the target DNA. The target DNA resides
                    within a larger DNA molecule that acts as a template. The amplified DNA, or PCR
                    product, can also serve as a template, leading to a “chain reaction” that
                    doubles the amount of PCR product after each cycle. Consequently, PCR can be
                    used to amplify small amounts of DNA from forensic samples or historical
                    artifacts. When scientists have a larger sample of DNA, they can determine the
                    base sequence of the sample and use the data to compare the DNA sequences of
                    different individuals. This process can help forensic scientists figure out the
                    identity of a person who left blood at a crime scene. It can also help decide
                    paternity disputes.
