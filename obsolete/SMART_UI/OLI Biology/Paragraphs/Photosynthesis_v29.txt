Oxygen (O2) is a product of photosynthesis. This product is essential for other living organisms (such as humans and any organism that uses cellular respiration). When the first photosynthetic cells evolved on the primitive earth, they caused a drastic increase in oxygen concentration within the atmosphere. This increase in oxygen concentration changed the face of our planet as organisms that couldnâ€™t adapt died off and new organisms evolved.
