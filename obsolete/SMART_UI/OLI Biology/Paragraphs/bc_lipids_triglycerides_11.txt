Fats and oils are called triglycerides because they are made of three (“tri”)
					fatty acids attached to one glycerol. A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid, a
					charged polar functional group, that
					contains a long hydrocarbon chain. The fatty acids are usually 16
					to 22 carbons long, but can range from 4 to 36 carbons in length.
