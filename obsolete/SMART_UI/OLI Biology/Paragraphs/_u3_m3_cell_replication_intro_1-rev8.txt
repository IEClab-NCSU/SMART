Remember that germ cells, found in the ovaries and testes, give rise to
					gametes. In other words, germ cells go through meiosis to produce gametes. Germ
					cells are diploid cells. When they go through meiosis, the end result is four
					unique haploid daughter cells! These haploid cells can be fertilized by other
					haploid cells to produce diploid cells again.
