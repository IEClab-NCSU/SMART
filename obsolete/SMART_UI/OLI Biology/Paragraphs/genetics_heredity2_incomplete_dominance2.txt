Continued genetic research has revealed that inheritance is usually more
                    complicated than simple dominance. Some genes follow Mendelian patterns of
                    inheritance, but many are governed instead by non-Mendelian
                    inheritance. Mendel himself realized this when he looked at species and
                    characteristics beyond the scope of his research. For example, although the
                    cross of a true-bred purple-flowered pea plant with a true-bred white-flowered
                    pea plant will result in purple flowers, the cross of true-bred red flower and
                    true-bred white flower snapdragons will result in offspring with pink flowers.
                    If the pink snapdragons are crossed with each other, pink, red, and white
                    flowers will appear in a 2:1:1 ratio, respectively. How can this happen?
