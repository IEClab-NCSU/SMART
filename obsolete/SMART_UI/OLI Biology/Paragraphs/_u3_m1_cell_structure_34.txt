Most organelles are found in the cytoplasm, which is the substance found
			between the nucleus and the cell membrane. Mitochondria (singular:
				mitochondrion) and chloroplasts (only in plant cells) are
			the organelles responsible for providing energy for all cellular functions. Both
			structures are similar to bacteria in many ways. In fact, it is now thought that they
			are derived from ancient bacteria that lived within larger primitive eukaryotic cells.
			That is, they were endosymbionts: organisms that live within a larger host.
			They carried out energy functions that gave their hosts an advantage. Eventually, they
			became fully integrated within the larger host cell. Today, both mitochondria and
			chloroplasts retain their own circular DNA. They also reproduce by division, just like
			bacteria! However, they cannot live outside the eukaryotic cell. Some prokaryotes
			related to mitochondria and chloroplasts have remained free-living. Although they do not
			have mitochondria or chloroplasts within their cells, they are able to carry out similar
			energy functions.
