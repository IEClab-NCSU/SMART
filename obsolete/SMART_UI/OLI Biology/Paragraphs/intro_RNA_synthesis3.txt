The DNA must be unwound starting at a specific DNA sequence
Replication – Origin of Replication
Transcription – The Promoter


The process requires a template that is DNA
Replication – Complementary copies of both strands are created simultaneously
Transcription – A complementary copy is made of one strand


The process does not require a primer
Replication – A primer with a 3’ hydroxyl is required for DNA polymerase
Transcription – No primer is required for RNA polymerase


Synthesis is unidirectional in the 5’ to 3’ direction
Synthesis requires four nucleotide triphosphates
Replication – deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates include dATP, dGTP, dCTP,
            dTTP
Transcription – ribonucleotide triphosphates include ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP
