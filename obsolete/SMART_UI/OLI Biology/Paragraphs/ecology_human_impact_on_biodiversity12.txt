In the past, humans were often unaware of the effects of their actions or did not try to
            change course until it was too late. Today, with advances in technology and ecological
            science, we can do much better. We have begun to effectively regulate or prohibit
            harvesting, reduce some forms of pollution, protect remaining habitats, and control
            introduced species. As a result, the status of many populations in high-income nations
            or in priority areas is improving. In the United States, several species, including the
            American beaver, the American bison, and the gray wolf, have been protected from
            overharvesting and have recovered and returned to much of their former range. The bald
            eagle and peregrine falcon were nearly driven extinct by the pesticide DDT and related
            compounds that entered food chains, concentrated in the birds, and impaired their
            introduction. Both species have recovered strongly since DDT was banned for use in the
            U.S. in 1972. As seen in the graph below, these and similar cases have led to an overall
            increase in many vertebrate animal populations within high-income nations in North
            America, Europe, Australia, and Japan since 1970.
