The additional atoms that are found only on glucose are
					electronegative, meaning that they will withdraw some of
					the electrons from the atoms that form bonds with them. The electronegative atom
					will have a slight negative charge, and the atom that it is
							bonded to it will have a slight positive charge.
					The unequal distribution of electrons makes the bond a polar
							bond.
