ADP and inorganic phosphate bind to the subunits that have high affinity for these
            compounds.
A three protons flow through the Fo domain, causing a 120o
            rotation of the 

-subunit.
The rotation of the 

-subunit causes a conformational change in the 
-
 subunits.
 ATP is more stable in the new conformation of the 
-
 subunits, consequently the bound ADP and inorganic phosphate is spontaneously
            converted to ATP.
Another three protons flow through the Fo domain, causing another
            120o rotation of the 

 subunit.
This rotation causes an additional conformational change of the 
-
 subunits, generating the conformation that has low affinity for ATP and ADP,
            thus the newly synthesized ATP is released.
A three additional protons flows through the Fo domain, causing another
            rotation of 

 subunits. This restores the system to the starting conditions.
