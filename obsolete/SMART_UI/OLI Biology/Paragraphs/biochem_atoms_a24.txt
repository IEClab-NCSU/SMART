Atoms are unimaginably small. Even within a single microscopic cell,
					there is room for not just billions, but trillions or even hundreds of trillions
					of atoms. Amazingly, however, physicists now understand that most of the volume
					of an atom is actually made up of empty space. The atoms themselves are made of
					even smaller subatomic particles called protons, neutrons, and
						electrons. We cannot look at the parts of atoms with a microscope;
					they are simply too small. However, physicists have learned a great deal about
					atoms and subatomic particles through indirect methods. One model of the atom is
					shown in the diagram below.
