As you start to learn about biology, you will notice that there is a lot
							of chemistry involved! Chemistry is the study of atoms and how they
							interact. Chemistry is important for biology because all matter,
							including living organisms, is made up of atoms. Therefore, in order to
							understand biology we must understanding something of how atoms
							interact. Life can move, reproduce, grow, and use energy because of
							processes that happen at the scale of atoms and molecules. A carbon atom
							is shown here. As you will find out, carbon is a very important atom in
							biology.
