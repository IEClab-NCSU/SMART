You have already learned that cells are made up of organelles, molecules, atoms, and
			subatomic particles. These parts assemble into various structures to perform specific
			functions within the cell. An organelle is a specialized structure
			formed when a specific set of molecules bond, providing a subunit that performs a
			particular function within the cell. Many, but not all, organelles are structures
			enclosed by a membrane. Some structures are the same for both
					prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell
			types and some structures are different. The remainder of this page will focus on a
			handful of structures that all cells have in common. Then, later in this module, you
			will learn about the structures and characteristics of each cell type in more detail.
