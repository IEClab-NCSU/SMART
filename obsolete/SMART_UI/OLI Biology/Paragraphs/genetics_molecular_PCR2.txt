PCR is essentially DNA replication, and just like DNA replication, PCR relies on
                    the enzyme DNA polymerase. Because DNA polymerase requires a primer before it
                    can start building a new strand of DNA, this is the first thing scientists must
                    find (or design). These primers will provide a starting point for the DNA
                    polymerase. In DNA replication, the primers are made of RNA nucleotides. In PCR,
                    the primers are short DNA molecules consisting of a specific sequence that
                    flanks the right and left ends of the target DNA sequence. The PCR product will
                    contain the DNA sequences of the primers and the DNA between the primers.
