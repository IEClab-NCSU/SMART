Transport. Because the plasma membrane is only semipermeable, the
						cell needs a way to transport larger materials into and out of the
						cell.

Communication. Because the plasma membrane is the border of the
						cell, this is where the cell communicates with its environment. Membrane
						proteins are able to receive signals from outside the cell and begin a chain
						of events that cause the cell to respond to these signals. 

Metabolism. Membrane proteins can be enzymes that are involved in
						the chemical reactions of metabolism. These are the processes that allow the
						cell to grow, obtain energy, and eliminate wastes.
Adhesion. Membrane proteins help cells bind to each other and form tissues. One
						example of this is skin cells, which must form a tight surface if the skin
						is to maintain proper integrity. Membrane proteins also bind to molecules
						inside and outside the cell, which helps the cell maintain its
						structure.
