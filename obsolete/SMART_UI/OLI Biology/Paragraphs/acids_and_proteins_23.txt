Proteins can catalyze chemical reactions by accelerating the rate at which
						chemical reactions take place in the cell. Proteins that catalyze reactions
						are called enzymes. 
Proteins play a role in the storage, replication, transmission, and
						regulation of genetic information (DNA). Some proteins bind to DNA and
						either reduce the expression of a gene, or activate the expression of a
						gene.
Proteins can help move substances in and out of the cell. These proteins can
						be embedded in the cell membrane, where they act as transporters.
Some soluble proteins can transport materials throughout the body.
						Hemoglobin is a protein that is found in high concentrations in red blood
						cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to our tissues.
Proteins can recognize specific molecules. Protein receptors found in the
						lining of your nose recognize and bind to chemicals in the air, which
						triggers a message to the brain indicating the presence of a certain
						smell.
Proteins can facilitate mechanical movement. Special proteins found in
						muscle cells use the energy in ATP to flex your muscles. 
Proteins can help maintain structure in an organism. The cellular
						cytoskeleton consists of proteins that form long fibrous scaffolding in
						cells that helps the cell maintain its shape.
