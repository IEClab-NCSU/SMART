In this unit, you will learn about another major cell process â€” cell division, or
			cell reproduction. The word "reproduction" is used in many different scientific and
			nonscientific settings. Regardless of the setting, though, reproduction has the same
			basic meaning. Reproduction is defined as "the act of making a copy of the original."
			With this in mind, the word reproduction can be applied to many different situations.
			Some of these include parents having a baby, you photocopying a page in your textbook,
			and a museum staff member making print copies of a famous oil painting.
