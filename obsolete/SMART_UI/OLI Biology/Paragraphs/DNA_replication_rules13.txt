During replication of circular chromosomes, such as in bacteria, the leading strand of
          synthesis from one replication fork eventually meets the lagging strand of synthesis for
          the other replication fork and there is complete synthesis of the entire chromosome. For
          linear chromosomes this same process happens between two origins of replication. However
          at the end of the linear chromosomes, the telomeres, the lagging strand does not
          completely replicate to match the length of DNA generated on the leading strand. Thus for
          repeated replication of the chromosomes during multiple cell divisions, this means that
          the chromosomes are shortened with each cycle of replication.
