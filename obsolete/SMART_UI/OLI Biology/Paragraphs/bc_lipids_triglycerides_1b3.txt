Since the early 20th century, modified vegetable oils have been produced that are
				solid at room temperature. Examples include margarine and vegetable shortening. To
				make these products, a chemical process is used to add hydrogen to vegetable oil.
				Many of the double bonds in the fatty acids are replaced by single bonds (and
				hydrogen atoms), but some double bonds remain in the partially hydrogenated oils
				that result. This process increases shelf-life and produces flaky rather than
				crumbly crusts when used for baking. As a side effect of the chemical
				transformation, the orientation of some of the remaining double bonds is shifted.
				The naturally occurring double bonds are converted to trans
				double bonds, making "trans fats."
