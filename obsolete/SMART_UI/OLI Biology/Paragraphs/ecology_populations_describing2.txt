Population size, often represented by the variable N, is the total number of individuals in a population at a
			particular point in time. Population size can be an abstract concept, particularly for
			small organisms whose numbers can be astronomical. A single species of mosquito in a
			swamp might easily number in the millions or even billions of individuals. It is often
			better and more practical to describe such populations in terms of their density.
