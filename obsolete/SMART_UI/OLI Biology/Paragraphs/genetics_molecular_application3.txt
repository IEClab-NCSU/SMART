If the two DNA samples show a different number of repeats, then the samples must have
            come from two different individuals. If two DNA samples show the same number of repeats
            at one location, then there is a chance that the two DNA samples came from the same
            individual. This is not a very reliable indication that the DNA samples came from the
            same individual, since a significant fraction of people can have the same number of
            tandem repeats at any one location in the chromosome. To increase the reliability of a
            positive match between the two samples, a total of 13 different locations of tandem
            repeats are amplified, and the number of repeats at each location are compared. If any
            of the 13 locations differ in the number of repeats, the two DNA samples came from
            different individuals. However, if all 13 agree, there is a greater than 99.99 percent
            probability that the two DNA samples came from the same individual. There is still a
            0.01 percent chance that the DNA came from two different people who just happened to
            have the same number of tandem repeats at each of the 13 different locations.
