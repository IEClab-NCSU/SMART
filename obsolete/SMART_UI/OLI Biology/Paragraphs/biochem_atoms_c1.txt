Atoms of different elements differ in their size, the reactions they participate
					in, and many other features. Yet there are some regular patterns that make it
					easier for us to categorize elements and understand why they behave as they do.
					The first key characteristic that truly identifies an element is its 
					atomic number,
					the number of protons in each atom. The
					atomic number is constant and identical for all atoms of an element. For
					example, hydrogen always has only 1 proton and has an atomic number of 1. If an
					atom has 2 protons, it has an atomic number of 2 and it is helium. The periodic
					table of elements organizes all known elements into one table. As you will see,
					there is a logic to its organization. When you grasp the patterns in the
					periodic table, you will have an easier time understanding the chemical
					reactions that enable life.
