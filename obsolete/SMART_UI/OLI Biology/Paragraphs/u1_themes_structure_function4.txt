Structure also determines biological function at higher levels of
				organization. Your body’s organs function as they do because of how tissues are put
				together, forming filters, pumps, levers, gas exchange surfaces, pipes for air and
				fluid flow, etc. And, of course, the entire body of an organism is suited to its
				lifestyle and environment. The earthworm is quite obviously well-suited to
				burrowing: it is slimy, muscular, flexible, and cylindrical. Yet there are many
				surprising details even in the humble worm’s structure. Next time you get the
				chance, FEEL an earthworm. Pinch it carefully near the head with one hand, then rub
				your free forefinger against its belly. You’ll notice prickly hairs on the worm’s
				underside. And you’ll find that you only feel them when you move your finger toward
				the worm’s head: the hairs are set at an angle, gripping the soil to help the worm
				move forward
				through the earth.
