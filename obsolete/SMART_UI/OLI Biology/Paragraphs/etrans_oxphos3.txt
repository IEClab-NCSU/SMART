 The electron transport chain consists of four multi-protein complexes that are
          contained within the inner mitochondrial membrane. These complexes remove
          electrons from NADH or FADH2 molecules that were generated by oxidative
          processes in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. These high energy compounds ultimately deposit
          their electrons on oxygen, forming water. The energy that is released by electron
          transport is stored as a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This
          proton gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP.
