The cell is the fundamental unit of life;
			therefore, you might think that your study of biology should begin with the cell. In
			fact, before you can truly understand how a cell functions, you must understand the
			building blocks from which cells are made. In the Introduction to
				Biology module, you learned that all life exhibits a hierarchical organization.
			While cells are the first level of organization that displays all the properties of
			life, their component parts (atoms and molecules) are not alive, as illustrated in the
			inverted pyramid below.
