In this module you learned about the role of DNA as the molecule that stores genetic
			information. Any damage to the DNA molecule can have serious consequences for the cell.
			There are many different cellular mechanisms to repair DNA damage or to stop a cell with
			errors in its DNA from dividing. The BRCA genes code for proteins involved in
			detecting and repairing double strand breaks in the DNA molecule.
