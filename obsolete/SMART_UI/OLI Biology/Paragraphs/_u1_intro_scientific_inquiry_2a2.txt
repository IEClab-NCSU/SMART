In the activity below, you can practice recognizing scientific hypotheses. As you
					consider each statement, try to think as a scientist would: can I test this
					hypothesis with observations or experiments? Is the statement falsifiable? In
					other words, is it possible to gather evidence that clearly indicates that the
					statement is not true? If the answer is “no,” the statement is not a valid
					scientific hypothesis.
