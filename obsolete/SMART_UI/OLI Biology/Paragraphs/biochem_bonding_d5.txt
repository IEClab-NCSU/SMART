Hydrogen bonding can occur whenever hydrogen is covalently bound to strongly
					electronegative elements like oxygen or nitrogen. These hydrogen atoms carry a
					positive partial charge and can be attracted to negative partial charges on
					other molecules, or on different parts of the same molecule. Hydrogen bonds are
					important to the structure and function of many large biological molecules. DNA,
					for example, occurs as a double-stranded molecule. The two strands are loosely
					connected by hydrogen bonds.
