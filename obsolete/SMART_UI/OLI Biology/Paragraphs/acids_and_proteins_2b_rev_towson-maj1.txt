The order of the amino acids in a particular protein is determined by information encoded in
			the cell's genes, and the order of amino acids is referred to as the sequence of the
			protein. An example of a protein sequence is shown below where the one-letter
			abbreviations are used for each of the 20 amino acids used in cellular protein
			synthesis. By convention, the first amino acid is at the end with the free amino group
			and the last amino acid is at the end with the carboxylic acid group.
