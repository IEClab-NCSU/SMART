Smooth muscles control involuntary functions of the body, such as
                    arterial contractions to move blood and peristaltic contractions in the
                    digestive system to move food. Smooth muscles lack striations thus, are termed
                    smooth due to their appearance. They are composed of muscle fibers with a single
                    nucleus in each cell and are uninucleate. Smooth muscles do not have any
                    attachment to the skeletal system. Smooth muscle has the ability to produce its
                    own contractions involuntarily. However, as with skeletal muscle, electrical
                    signals from the nervous system can modulate the activities of smooth muscle.
                    The organization of smooth muscle on a cellular level is irregular and
                    unorganized. Therefore, smooth muscle does not contain sarcomeres.
