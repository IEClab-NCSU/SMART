The final stage of the Central Dogma is translation, which is defined as RNA Directed Protein
      Synthesis. This process is unique in that it takes information from one type of polymer (RNA)
      and translates that linear information into the linear sequence of a totally different
      polymer, a protein. This unit will describe that process and the elements that are required to
      have it function. The discussion will be organized around,
