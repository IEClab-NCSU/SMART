One striking feature of life is its adaptation: the exquisite “fit” between organisms and
            their natural environments. In their behavior, structure, and chemistry organisms are
            very well-suited to the conditions of life they experience. They may be astonishingly
            cryptic (camouflaged) in their natural backgrounds. They may tolerate extremes of cold,
            heat, salinity, or other factors unique to their habitat. Adaptive traits are any
            inherited characteristics - physical, chemical, or behavioral - that enable an
            organism’s successful reproduction in a given environment.
