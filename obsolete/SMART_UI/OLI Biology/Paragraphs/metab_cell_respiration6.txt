As we have emphasized thus far, cells juggle energy through opposing
			reactions. Photosynthesis is an anabolic pathway fueled by solar
			energy that allows the synthesis of organic molecules from simple raw materials. Catabolic
			pathways reverse this process. They break molecules down into simpler components. The
			centrally important catabolic pathway that is complementary to photosynthesis is cellular
				respiration. Although there are many other catabolic reactions occurring in
			any cell, cellular respiration supplies the vast majority of ATP molecules required for
			cellular work in aerobic organisms.
