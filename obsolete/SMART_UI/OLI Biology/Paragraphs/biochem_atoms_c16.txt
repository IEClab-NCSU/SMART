Scientists have learned that isotopes have many useful properties. Some isotopes
					can be used to trace chemical reactions. If a special isotope is placed in
					fertilizer, for instance, that same isotope will later show up in the tissues of
					plants, then animals and decomposers as the nutrient moves through the food web.
					Some isotopes break down into others at a constant rate, allowing us to
					determine the age of fossils or artifacts. When an isotope is radioactive, this
					means that it emits some energy (radiation) when it breaks down to a different
					isotope. Radioactive isotopes can be used to visualize certain tissues for
					medical diagnosis. For example, radioactive iodine tends to concentrate in the
					thyroid gland. It emits radiation as it breaks down to another isotope of
					iodine. Special cameras can pick up this radiation and use it to create an image
					of the thyroid gland. This can help determine if the patientâ€™s thyroid is
					normally active or to detect thyroid cancer.
