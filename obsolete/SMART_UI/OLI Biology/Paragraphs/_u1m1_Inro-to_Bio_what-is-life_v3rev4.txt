The cell is the smallest unit that displays all of these characteristics. Because
					of this, living organisms are often identified based on whether or not they are
					made of cells. Nonliving things can show several of these characteristics. For
					example, a rock crystal can “grow” in a simple fashion. However, if even one of
					these conditions is not met (rock crystals do not reproduce with help from DNA),
					the object in question cannot be considered alive.
