Fats are mainly energy storage and insulating molecules. Per gram,
					fats contain twice as much energy as carbohydrates. Layers of fat also surround
					the vital organs of animals to help cushion and protect them. In some animals,
					layers of fat under the skin provide insulation. This is particularly true of
					marine endotherms (i.e., organisms that maintain internal body
					temperature using their own metabolism) that live in cold polar regions, like
					penguins, whales, and seals. These are all examples of animals with thick
					insulating “blubber” beneath the skin.
