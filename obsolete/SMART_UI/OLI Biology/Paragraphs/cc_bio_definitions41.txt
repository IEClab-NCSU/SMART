Greenhouse gases absorb and reemit heat waves (infrared radiation).  Three important greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4).  Much of the heat (infrared) radiation that leaves Earth’s surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and reemitted back toward Earth.  As a result, these gases retain heat in the atmosphere.  Instead of escaping immediately to space, heat is delayed near the Earth’s surface and continues to warm our atmosphere.
