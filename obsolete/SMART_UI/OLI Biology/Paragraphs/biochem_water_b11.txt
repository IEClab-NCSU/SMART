Some molecules are hydrophobic, which literally means fear (phobia) of
			water (hydro). These molecules do not like to dissolve in water.
			When hydrophobic molecules are mixed with water, they will tend to
			separate into distinct phases (or layers), one containing water and the other containing
			the hydrophobic molecules. This makes it very difficult, for example, to “wash” oil off
			of waterfowl after an oil spill.
