Most of the treatments for cystic fibrosis involve making sure the lungs remain clear of the
					thick, sticky mucus. This can be done using drugs that thin the respiratory
					mucus, like Pulmozyme. A more recently discovered treatment involves the
					inhalation of hypertonic saline solution. This salty solution causes water to
					move from the cells and into the airways (via osmosis), making the mucus more
					watery and easier to cough up.
