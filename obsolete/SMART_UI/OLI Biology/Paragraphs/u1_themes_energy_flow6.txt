At the ecosystem level, energy flow explains why food chains are usually short
                    and predators are often rare: energy is released as heat as it passes through
                    each feeding level in an ecosystem. Nutrient cycling traces how consumers and
                    producers interact to alter the chemistry of the air, water, and soil. By
                    studying nutrient cycles, we can appreciate the roles of algae and plants in
                    making our air breathable. We learn how bacteria make soil fertile. In energy
                    flow we see chains that tie us to the sun; in nutrient cycling we see ties that
                    bind all living things to each other.
