 The energy that has been stored in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial
          membrane cannot be easily utilized by other processes in the cell. It must be converted to
          a more usable source, such as ATP. The enzyme ATP synthase is responsible for converting
          the energy stored in the proton gradient to ATP. This enzyme is found in the inner
          mitochondrial membrane and it projects into the matrix.
