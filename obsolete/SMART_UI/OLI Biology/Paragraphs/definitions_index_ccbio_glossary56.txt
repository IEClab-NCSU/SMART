Protective and reinforcing structure found in certain cells, situated
                                outside the plasma membrane. Bacterial cell walls are mainly built
                                of peptidoglycan, although they may also contain lipidic molecules.
                                Among eukaryotes, plants and fungi possess cell walls, made of
                                cellulose and chitin, respectively.
