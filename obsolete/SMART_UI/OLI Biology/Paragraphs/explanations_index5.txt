Amino acids with non-polar side chains contain, primarily, hydrocarbons and no polar 
                    functional groups containing electronegative atoms. Note that the term “nonpolar” refers 
                    only to the side chain, while the amino acid as a whole is charged at physiological pH due 
                    to the carboxyl and amino groups.
