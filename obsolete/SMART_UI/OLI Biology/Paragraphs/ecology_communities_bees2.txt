Ongoing declines in bee populations are a major focus for ecological research. Since
			about 2006, North American beekeepers have been plagued by a complex problem called
			colony collapse disorder, in which worker bees abandon their hives. Research has
			implicated parasitic mites, viruses, pesticides, and other factors in causing bee colony
			declines. In 2012 scientists documented another threat: honeybees are being parasitized
			by a fly that was not previously known to interact with them. The fly lays its eggs on
			worker bees and its larvae live within bees, feeding on their body tissues. When the fly
			larvae are mature, the worker bee hostswander away from their hives at night and die
			away from the colony. The fly larvae then abandon the host, beheading it as they
			exit.
