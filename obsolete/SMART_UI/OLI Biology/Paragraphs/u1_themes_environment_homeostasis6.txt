You can probably imagine other ways to use the shapes and materials at hand, building a
            body that will help Structo overcome many different challenges. Environmental pressures
            have led (and continue to lead) to the evolution of organisms with a virtually infinite
            range of such combinations. In fact, one of the hottest areas of engineering right now
            is biomimicry: looking at natural solutions to problems and using similar approaches to
            build better technology. One of the earliest uses of this approach was the invention of
            Velcro (hook and loop attachment) by Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral. He was inspired
            by the burrs that got stuck in his dogâ€™s fur!
