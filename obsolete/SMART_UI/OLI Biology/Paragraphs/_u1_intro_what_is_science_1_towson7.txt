McClintock had discovered that when transposons where present, they controlled the expression or inhibition of neighboring
                        genes on a chromosome. The presence of transposons determined whether a corn kernel was yellow, brown, purple, or speckled. 
                        Although McClintock followed her creative intuition in making these discoveries in the 1950s, she didnot receive the Nobel 
                        Prize for her work until 1983. Subsequent research has shown the presence of transposons in the genetic material of almost 
                        all living organisms and these transposons serve as an important source of genetic variation.
