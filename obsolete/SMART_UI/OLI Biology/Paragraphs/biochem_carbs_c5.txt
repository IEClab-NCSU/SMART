Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the molecules involved
					with storing our genetic information (DNA) or the conversion of that information
					into proteins (RNA). Sugars (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA) play a part in
					the structure of these nucleic acid molecules. They alternate with phosphate
					groups to make up the long backbone of nucleic acids, as shown below.
