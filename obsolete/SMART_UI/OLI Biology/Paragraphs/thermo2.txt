 It is useful to have a quantitative way to predict the direction of a pathway given the
          current environment in the cell. A method of predicting the direction of a reaction was
          devised by J. Willard Gibbs in 1876 and the quantitative parameter that can be used to
          predict the direction of a reaction is called the Gibbs free energy. This method
          is particularly useful because it can be applied to reactions that are not at equilibrium,
          which is the situation encountered during metabolism. Before we can discuss the Gibbs free
          energy, we have to discuss standard energies and their relationship to equilibrium
          positions of reactions. Keep in mind that these discussions relate to the
            thermodynamic properties of pathways, more specifically the relative energy
          differences between reactants and products under cellular conditions. The presence of
          enzymes simply increases the rate of conversion from reactants to products, the enzyme
          cannot alter the relative energies of these compounds.
