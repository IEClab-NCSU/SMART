All living things are made of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and they all contain roughly the same blend of chemical elements.  The most important are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S).  Earth has a finite stock of each of these chemical elements, but the atoms are immortal.  In any transfer or reaction the total number of atoms of each element will stay the same.  Matter does not disappear or appear from nothing; it is conserved.
