Evolution is that and much more. In the first module, we will introduce and define the
                    biological theory of evolution. In the second module we will focus on relatively
                    fast and subtle changes that occur within populations (microevolution). In the
                    third module we will consider the much more dramatic changes that occur over
                    long time scales and generate the diversity of life (macroevolution). As you
                    learn, try to maintain an open mind and evaluate the evidence on its own merits.
                    You will gain a better understanding of a scientific theory that is very
                    influential in our society.
