Fact 2: Viruses mutate rapidly. This is one of the reasons there is a
					new flu vaccine each year. The flu is caused by a virus, and the flu vaccine
					helps the body recognize and defend itself against the current flu virus. By
					next year, the virus population will have changed so much that the current
					immunizations will no longer work.
