An analogy might help you to recognize what we’re getting at here. Two students are
            brought into a professor’s office. They are shown their term papers, side by side.
            Bill’s paper begins: “Phylogenetic biology is the exhaustive comparison of taxonomic
            units in an attempt to elucidate the ancestral relationships among all life forms on the
            planet Earth.” Sarah’s paper starts with the exact same
            sentence. At several points, the papers have identical or extremely similar
            wording.
