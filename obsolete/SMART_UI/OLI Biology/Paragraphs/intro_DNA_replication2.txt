In addition, an understanding of the enzymes that are involved in faithfully copying the DNA
      has also lead to their use in applications that have advanced our knowledge of genomes, the
      information they contain and how they are used. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
      sequencing using dideoxynucleotides have revolutionized our ability to work with small amounts
      of DNA and generate immense amounts of sequence information in a very short time. The
      understanding of the basic principles involved in DNA replication have also lead to our
      understanding of such topics as DNA repair and chromosome extension.
