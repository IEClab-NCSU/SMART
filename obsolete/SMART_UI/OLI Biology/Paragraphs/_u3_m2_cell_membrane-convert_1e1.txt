Prokaryotes are an enormously diverse group of organisms. However, they can
			be organized into two primary groups: bacteria and archaea.
			While both bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes (both groups lack nuclei), the archaeans
			have some interesting structural characteristics in the cell membrane that have unique
			functional significance.
