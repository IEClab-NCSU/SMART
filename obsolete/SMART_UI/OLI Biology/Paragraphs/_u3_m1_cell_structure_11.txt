The microscopes we use today are far more advanced than those used in the 1600s by Antony
			van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch shopkeeper who had great skill in crafting lenses. Despite the
			limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of
			bacteria, other single-celled organisms and sperm.  He labeled these moving
			microbes
			“animalcules”.
