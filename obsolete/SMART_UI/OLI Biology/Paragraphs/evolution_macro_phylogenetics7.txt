It seems unlikely that these four animals (not to mention thousands of others) would
            develop such similar limb structures by chance. It also does not appear to be necessary.
            Why should a whale flipper have embedded fingers, wrist bones, and three major limb
            bones? If adaptive evolution was starting “from scratch,” it might “design” a flipper
            with just a few bony plates. Instead, evidence supports the idea that all four-limbed
            vertebrates descend from a common ancestor; they all inherit their curious and specific
            arrangement of limb bones from that source. In separate lineages, adaptation has
            reshaped the limbs and suited them to very different functions. At first glance, a whale
            flipper and a hummingbird wing have little in common, but the details
            of the structures point to shared ancestry. Let’s take a moment to assess your
            understanding of homologous features.
