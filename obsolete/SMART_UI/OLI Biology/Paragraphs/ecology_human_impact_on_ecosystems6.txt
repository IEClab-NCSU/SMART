If the Earth had no atmosphere, heat would escape very rapidly. The Earth’s
                    night-time surface temperatures would be like those on the moon: −153° Celsius,
                    −243° Fahrenheit. Below is a diagram showing what Earth’s energy balance might
                    look like if there were no clouds to reflect light and no gases that could
                    interfere with heat’s escape.
