Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and
					predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the
					successes of science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to
					the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas
					promoted by religious leaders. Some of these prescientific remedies worked, but
					the process for discovering new treatments was a slow and haphazard system of
					trial and error. Ineffective treatments were often accepted simply because there
					was no clear procedure for evaluating them. Today, with science-based medicine
					and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats
					to our health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life
					expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900.
