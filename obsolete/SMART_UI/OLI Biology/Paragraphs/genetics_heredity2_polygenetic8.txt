Another gene known to have pleiotropic effects in humans is fibrillin-1,
                            which codes for a connective tissue protein. Marfan syndrome is caused
                            by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. People with Marfan syndrome are
                            usually tall and thin with long arms and legs, and they are at risk for
                            heart disease and eye problems. The symptoms can be treated
                            individually, and people with Marfan syndrome may have normal life
                            spans.
