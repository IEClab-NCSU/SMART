The cell can use pH as a mechanism to control enzyme action. Enzymes used in
					digestion that destroy other proteins could be detrimental to a cell. However,
					typically these enzymes are only active at low pH such as is found in the
					stomach or in intracellular compartments such as the lysosome that is maintained
					at lower pH than the cytoplasm.
