The energy difference between ATP and ADP is largely due to the interaction between the
					negatively charged phosphate groups in each molecule. You may remember that
					unlike charges (+ and -) attract each other, while like charges (+ and +; or -
					and -) repel each other. Energy is therefore required to move two negative
					charges close to each other, which is what happens when ATP is made from ADP and
					phosphate. This is similar to the way in which energy is required to bring the
					two north poles of a bar magnet together.
