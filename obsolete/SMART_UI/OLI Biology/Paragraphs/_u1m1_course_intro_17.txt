All living things grow, develop and reproduce. We will focus on the ways
					different types of cells reproduce themselves in Unit 6: Cell Division.
					Genetic information in cells provides the instructions for carrying out life
					processes. In order for life to continue, organisms must pass information to the
					next generation. How genetic information is passed from one generation to the
					next is discussed in Unit 7: Classical Genetics. The physical traits an
					organism displays are ultimately determined by the DNA found within the
					organismâ€™s cells. In Unit 8: Molecular Genetics, we will connect
					heredity to DNA, the genetic material of the cell. We will specifically explore
					DNA function and figure out how DNA determines the heritable traits that
					individual organisms can pass to their offspring.
