Two types of eukaryotic cells are plant cells and animal
					cells. Because they are both eukaryotes, both cell types have
					nuclei. However, there are several structures that
			distinguish the two types of cells. For example, plant cells have
					chloroplasts and a cell wall. Animal
			cells lack both of these structures.
