It is important at this point to clarify the difference between
                            matter and energy and to
                    highlight a form of energy that is very important in biology. Food contains
                    nutrients that are useful to humans. These nutrients take up space and can be
                    weighed. Imagine a serving of breakfast cereal. You can weigh and measure the
                    volume of its nutrients, and on food labels nutrient content (the amount of fat,
                    carbohydrates, protein, etc.) is reported in grams. But the same serving of
                    cereal also has a property called chemical potential
                        energy. This is energy stored in the structure of molecules that can be
                    converted to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction. If the cereal is
                    burned (a chemical reaction), its molecules will react with oxygen gas. Atoms
                    will change partners and the molecules will become much simpler. In the process,
                    energy will be released as heat and light. We can determine the amount of energy
                    in the cereal by burning it and measuring how much heat is released in the
                    process.
