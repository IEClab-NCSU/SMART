Cytokinesis is the separation of the cytoplasm into two new daughter cells. Animal cells
			divide when proteins pinch in the center of the cell until it separates into two. This
			region is called the cleavage furrow. Plant cells divide when new cell wall components
			are laid down in the center of the cell. This is called the cell plate.
