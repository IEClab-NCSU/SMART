(pl. mitochondria) - the powerhouse of
                                eukaryotic cell; the organelle whose primary function is to perform
                                cellular respiration, to convert chemical energy into a form that
                                can be used directly by the cell -- Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
                                Enclosed by two concentric membranes, it is where most of the cell's
                                ATP is made. A mitochondrion contains its own DNA as a single
                                circular chromosome.
