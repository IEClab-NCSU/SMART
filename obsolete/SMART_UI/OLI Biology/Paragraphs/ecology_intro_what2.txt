Ecology is the branch of biology that studies life at population and higher
					levels of organization, emphasizing how groups of living organisms interact with
					each other and with nonliving factors in their environment. The main levels of
					analysis in ecology are population, community, ecosystem,
					and biosphere. Let's examine the meaning of these terms to see how they differ
					from one another, and yet build upon one another. The diagram below summarizes
					how the levels of analysis relate and gives a specific example (the forest) to
					guide your understanding.
