Things composed of hydrophobic molecules generally include oils, fats, and greasy
			substances. Materials containing hydrophobic substances are often used for removal of
			oil from water and management of oil spills. Other molecules are
					hydrophilic, which means love (philic) of water, and readily dissolve in water.
