Letâ€™s begin with a diploid cell that is 2N = 4. This cell has two copies of each
					of its two chromosomes. During the S phase of interphase, the cell
					replicates its DNA. This results in two sister chromatids that are attached to each
					other at the centromere. The chromosomes have not condensed enough at this point
					to be visible with a microscope.
