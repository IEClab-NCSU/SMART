Protein-ligand interactions serve several important functions in the cell. They may be
			responsible for buffering the ligand concentration and the transport of ligands. Oxygen
			binding to myoglobin is an example of buffering while the protein hemoglobin is involved
			in the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.
