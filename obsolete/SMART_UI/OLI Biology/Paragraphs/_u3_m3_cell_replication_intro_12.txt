Each of us began life as a single cell called a zygote. This cell
					divided rapidly to produce a mass of genetically identical cells. These
					identical cells then differentiated into specific cell types (such as blood
					cell, liver cells, etc.) by turning certain genes on or off. Throughout our
					lives we continue to produce more genetically identical cells. These somatic
					cells are essential for growth and replacement of worn-out cells and
					tissues. Multicellular organisms continue to produce somatic cells
					throughout their lives using the process of mitosis, which will be
					discussed in the next module.
