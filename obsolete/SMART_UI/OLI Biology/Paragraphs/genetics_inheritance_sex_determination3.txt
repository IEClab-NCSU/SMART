Females have two copies of the X chromosome (XX), while males carry one X and one Y (XY).
            When gametes are
            formed, females will have only gametes that contain the X chromosome; males will have
            some gametes with X and others with Y. For a male baby, a Y gamete from the father has
            to meet the mother’s gamete. So the determination of a baby’s sex depends on which
            gamete the father contributes.
