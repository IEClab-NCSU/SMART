In nondisjunction, chromosomes are not separated correctly during
					metaphase I or II, resulting in gametes with too few or too many chromosomes.
					There are many genetic disorders associated with incorrect chromosome numbers.
					One of the most well known condition caused by nondisjunction is Down
						syndrome. Down syndrome results from nondisjunction of chromosome 21,
					resulting in a child with 3 copies of this chromosome (trisomy 21). Down
					syndrome appears in approximately 1 of every 1,000 children, and older women are
					at a higher risk of having babies with the condition. Chromosomal abnormalities
					can include sex chromosomes also. For example, males with Klinefelter syndrome
					have an extra X chromosome (XXY), and females with Turner syndrome have only one
					X chromosome (X_). Both these conditions are relatively benign and can be
					corrected with hormone treatment. Note that nondisjunction due to lack of
					separation of sister chromatids can occur also during mitosis.
