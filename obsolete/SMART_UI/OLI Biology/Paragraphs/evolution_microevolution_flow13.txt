As you can see from the examples presented here, mutations, gene flow and genetic drift
			are mechanisms that can alter the gene pool of a population leading to microevolution.
			While these mechanisms of evolution have been presented separately from the mechanisms
			of natural, artificial, and sexual selection, in reality it is likely that several or
			all of these mechanisms are at work at any given time to drive evolution. Evolution is a
			complicated process. It involves some relatively predictable elements (selection and
			gene flow) but also has many unpredictable aspects (mutation, genetic drift).
