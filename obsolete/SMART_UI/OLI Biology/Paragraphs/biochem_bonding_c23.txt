The molecular mass or weight of a molecule is the sum of the individual atomic
					weights. As with atomic weights it is convenient to use the weight of a mole of
					molecules. For example, the molecular mass of single methane molecule is 16 Da
					(12 from the carbon, 4 from the hydrogens). The weight of a mole of methane
					molecules is 16 grams
