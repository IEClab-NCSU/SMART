The ability of a molecule to pass through the
					membrane depends on its polarity and to some extent its size. Many
						nonpolar molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small
					hydrocarbons can flow easily through cell membranes. This feature of membranes
					is very important because hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in your
					blood, is contained within red blood cells. Oxygen must be able to freely cross
					the membrane so that hemoglobin can get fully loaded with oxygen in your lungs,
					and deliver it effectively to your tissues. Most polar substances are stopped by
					a cell membrane, except perhaps for small polar compounds like
					one-carbon alcohol, methanol, and water. Glucose is too large to pass through
					the membrane unassisted and a special transporter protein ferries it across.
					Certain types of diabetes are caused by misregulation of the glucose
					transporter. Charged ions, such as sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+)
					ions seldom go through a membrane; consequently, they also need special
					transporter molecules to pass through the membrane. The inability of Na+ and K+
					to pass through the membrane allows the cell to regulate the concentrations of
					these ions on the inside or outside of the cell. The conduction of electrical
					signals in your nerves is based on the ability of cells to control Na+ and K+
					levels.
