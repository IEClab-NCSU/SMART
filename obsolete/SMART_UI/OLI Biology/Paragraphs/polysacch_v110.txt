 Cellulose plays a structural role as the key component of a plant cell wall. Cellulose is an unbranched polymer, analogous to amylose; however, the linkages between the glucose subunits are beta-1,4, rather than alpha-1,4. This difference in configuration of glycosidic bond leads to differences in structure and in function.  Beta-1,4 linkage results in the linear and extended shape of the polymer structure, which allows the strands of cellulose to align and form a hydrogen-bonding network between the hydroxyls on the individual glucose subunits. This hydrogen bonding adds to the rigidity of cellulose cell wall.
