Because the enantiomers have identical functional groups attached to the chiral
					center they have identical physical and chemical properties - except for the
					direction they rotate plane polarized light. Experimentally, the enantiomers are
					distinguished by the direction of rotation of plane polarized light. The
					enantiomer that rotates light to the right is designated as D (dextro) form of
					the compound. The other enantiomer will rotate light in the opposite direction,
					and is designated as the L (levulo) form of the compound.
