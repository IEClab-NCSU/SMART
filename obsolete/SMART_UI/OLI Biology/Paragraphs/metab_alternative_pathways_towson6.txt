Fermentation is a very common metabolic pathway in
					microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast, resulting in alcoholic beverages,
					fermented milk products, and bread. In fermentation of alcoholic beverages,
					yeast is added to sugary juices or malt syrups. The container is sealed to
					exclude oxygen. Under these conditions, the yeast switches to fermentation and
					generates ethanol, the intoxicating “active ingredient” of alcoholic beverages.
					Eventually, however, ethanol concentrations reach a point where the yeasts
					themselves are inhibited and fermentation grinds to a halt. In this way, wine
					and beer are naturally limited in their alcohol content. High-alcohol liquors
					can be produced only by distillation, a chemical process that concentrates the
					alcohol.
