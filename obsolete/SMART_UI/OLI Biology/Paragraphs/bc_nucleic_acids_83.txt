Information contained in DNA is organized into genes and each gene
			contains instructions for making a functional product: an RNA molecule or a protein. The
			process of making the functional gene products is called gene expression. 
			Different cells can contain the same DNA, but express different
			genes and produce different proteins. For example, red blood cells produce protein
			hemoglobin required for delivery of oxygen throughout the body. Nerve cells contain the
			same DNA, but the hemoglobin gene is not expressed. Instead, nerve cells make RNA copies
			of the genes that encode proteins required for signaling.
