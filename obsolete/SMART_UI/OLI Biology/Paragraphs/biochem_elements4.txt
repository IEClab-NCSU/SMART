In biological systems, the major elements are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N),
			oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). These elements represent more than
			95% of the mass of a cell. Carbon is a major component of nearly all biological
			molecules. Some elements are found in relatively small amounts and are called “trace
				elements.” Examples include sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn),
			and Zinc (Zn). Throughout the course you will see how atoms of these elements are very
			important to the functioning of a cell.
