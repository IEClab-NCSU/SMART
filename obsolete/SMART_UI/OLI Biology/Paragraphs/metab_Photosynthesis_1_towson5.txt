Plants must then transport water upward to leaves and other tissues. This is quite a
			challenge for a tall plant. Plants have no moving parts that could power a pump, so
			their circulatory systems must work on different principles. Plants use specialized
			cells to move water. These cells are essentially long, thin tubes that transport water
			from the roots all the way up to hollow cavities in the leaves. Evaporation of water
			from leaves provides negative pressure that sucks water up the tubes. The thick cell
			wall that allows the tube cells to function without collapsing also provides the plant
			with structural stability. “Wood” is mainly the structural material that remains after
			these cells have died. Ultimately, an adaptation for moving water helps woody plants
			grow even taller than their less sturdy cousins, further enhancing their access to
			light.
