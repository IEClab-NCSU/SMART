The production of ATP from "high-energy" electrons on NADH and FADH2 occurs in two
      steps, electron transport followed by ATP synthesis. The energy obtained from electron
      transport is stored as a pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The combination
      of a concentration difference of hydrogen ions and a voltage difference accross this membrane
      is often referred to as an electrochemical gradient. The electrochemical gradient is
      a form of potential energy that is utilized by the enzyme ATP synthase to convert ADP to ATP.
      The coupling between the proton gradient and the chemical synthesis of ATP, was originally
      proposed by Dr. Peter Michell in 1961 as the chemiosmotic hypothesis. His theory
      proved to be true, leading to a Nobel prize for his work in 1978.
