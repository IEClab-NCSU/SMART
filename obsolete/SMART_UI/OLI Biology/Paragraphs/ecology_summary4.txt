Ecosystem ecology broadens the scope to include nonliving factors. Energy flows through
            ecosystems, starting with sunlight and leaving every living thing as heat. Organisms
            form complex food webs consisting of producers and consumers, some of which
            (detritivores and decomposers) consume dead material. Species occupy different trophic
            levels based on their place within food chains. An energy pyramid pattern results from
            the loss of about 90% of the energy with each trophic transfer. Unlike energy, matter is
            constantly recycled in ecosystems. Individual atoms take countless trips through
            biogeochemical cycles, passing through living things, air, water, and/or rocks and soil.
            Bacteria act as decomposers and/or nutrient transformers in some cycles.
