 In the Classical
                Genetics unit, you learned about the mechanisms of inheritance,
            focusing mostly on the organism and population levels in the hierarchy of life. In the
                Molecular Genetics unit, you will learn about the molecular basis of traits
            that characterize the organisms. You will develop an understanding on the molecular
            level of how genetic information is organized and used by living organisms.
