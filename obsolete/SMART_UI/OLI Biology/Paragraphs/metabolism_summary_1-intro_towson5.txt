ATP is a special
			molecule used by cells as their “energy currency.” ATP supplies energy for other
			cellular processes: cell movement and division, membrane transport, and anabolic
			pathways enabling growth. Anabolic pathways use energy stored in ATP for building
			complex molecules from simpler ones.
