 Such variation, even when a few monosaccharides are included, can give rise to an enormous
number of uniquely recognizable structures. In some cases these varied structures can be
			attached to proteins and lipids to be used as identification/signaling devices on the
			surface of cells. Each cell type and each species of microorganism can display a unique
			identification on its surface to be used in cell recognition and to identify partners in
			cell-cell interactions.
