In the last two sections, the topics of photosynthesis and cellular respiration have been
					introduced and discussed as independent processes. The focus of this module is
					on how the two processes are part of one larger cycle. There is a yin-yang
					relationship between the two processes â€” the product of one process is the
					starting material for the other.
