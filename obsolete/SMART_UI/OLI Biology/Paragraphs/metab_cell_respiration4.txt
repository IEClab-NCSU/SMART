Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine
					dinucleotide (FADH+) are enzymes found in most cells
					of the body. These molecules have the ability to accept and donate electrons
					resulting in the ability to shuttle (i.e., transport) electrons around the cell.
						NAD+ and FADH+ accept electrons and H+
					during the early stages of the cellular respiration process. When they have
					accepted the electrons and H+, they become:
