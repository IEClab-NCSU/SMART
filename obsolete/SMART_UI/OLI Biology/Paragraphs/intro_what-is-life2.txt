All matter can be classified into one of two groups: biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living). Something is considered biotic if it was ever 
				alive at some point in time; in this sense, a deceased individual buried in a wooden coffin underground is still biotic, as is the wood used 
				to make the coffin (the wood came from a tree that was once alive). However, not everything within, or made, by a biotic organism is biotic. 
				For example, urea, a component of urine, is abiotic.
