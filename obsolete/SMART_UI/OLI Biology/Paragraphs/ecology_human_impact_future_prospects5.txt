As their populations continue to expand, trends and projections indicate that
                    low- and middle-income nations will also continue to increase in their
                    affluence. Automobiles, electronic gadgets, and household conveniences like air
                    conditioning and indoor plumbing are likely to reach more and more people in
                    populous and fast-growing economies like those of Brazil, India, and China. What
                    does this mean for the global environment? By 2050, projections suggest that the
                    world’s humans may use a total of 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil
                    fuels, and biomass per year—three times the current consumption rate (United
                    Nations Environmental Programme, International Resource Panel, 2011). Will Earth
                    be able to sustain these high levels of consumption spread across a population
                    of 9 to 11 billion people? Much will depend on the next factor, technology.
