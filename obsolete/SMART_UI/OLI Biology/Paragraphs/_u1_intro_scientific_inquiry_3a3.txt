Dependent variables
            are known or hypothesized consequences; they are the effects that result from changes or
            differences in an independent variable. In an experiment, the dependent variables are
            those that the scientist measures before, during, and particularly at the end of the
            experiment to see if they have changed as expected. The dependent variable must be
            stated so that it is clear how it will be observed or measured. Rather than comparing
            “learning” among students (which is a vague and difficult to measure concept), an
            educational researcher might choose to compare test scores, which are very specific and
            easy to measure.
