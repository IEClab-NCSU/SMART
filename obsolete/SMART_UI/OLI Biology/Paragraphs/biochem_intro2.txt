Life can be understood and studied at many levels of organization, from simpler to more
			inclusive or complex levels. Organisms are made from a common set of building blocks,
			atoms, which combine to form molecules. Small molecules are brought together to form
			more complex biological macromolecules. The next level of organization is the organelle.
			Organelles are working units within cells. Atoms, molecules, macromolecules and
			organelles form cells, the smallest unit of life.
