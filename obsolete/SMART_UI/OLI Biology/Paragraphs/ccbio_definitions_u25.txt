A measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.
                        Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic. Solutions with a pH of 7 are
                        neutral. Solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. A one-point change in
                        pH is equal to a ten-fold difference in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).
