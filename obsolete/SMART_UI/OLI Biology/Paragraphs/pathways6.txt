It is possible to reverse the direction of a metabolic pathways, depending on the needs of
      the organisms; a degradative pathway can become a synthetic one. Many of the enzymes that
      catalyze reactions in one direction can be easily reversed, and thus function in both
      pathways. A small number of steps utilize different enzymes in the forward versus the reverse
      direction. These enzymes are regulated in a coordinated fashion such that a pathway operates
      in only direction at time.
