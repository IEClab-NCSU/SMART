Degradative, or catabolic, pathways generally produce energy. They usually begin
      with a number of different compounds, each of which represents a branch at the beginning of
      the pathway. These branches meet at a common intermediate, and the remaining section of the
      pathway is usually a linear segment. In this way a number of complex compounds are converted
      to a common intermediate, reducing the number of unique steps in the degradation of complex
      molecules.
