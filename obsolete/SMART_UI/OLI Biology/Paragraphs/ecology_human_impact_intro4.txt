Each of the above factors promotes greater environmental impact if all other
            factors are held equal. In real societies, however, all three factors change
            over time and influence each other. This leads to some surprising patterns of
            impact. For example, some environmental conditions are better in high-income
            nations than in lower-income countries. In general, the air and water are
            cleaner, industries are better-regulated, and forests are less heavily exploited
            in higher-income nations. We can account for this in two ways. First, goods can
            be consumed in one place but generate their impacts elsewhere. With global
            trade, many of the impacts of consumption occur in developing nations where
            goods are produced, dumped, or recycled. Second, more advanced technology is not
            always more disruptive; technology can also be developed to reduce impact.
            Examples of advanced low-impact technologies include renewable energy
            technologies (solar panels, windmill generators), biodegradable plastics,
            smokestack “scrubbers” that remove pollutants from power plant emissions, and
            energy-efficient appliances and buildings.
