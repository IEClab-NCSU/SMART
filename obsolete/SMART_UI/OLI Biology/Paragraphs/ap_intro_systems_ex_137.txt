The brain has several lobes, each of which carries out
                            specific functions and processes information associated with specific
                            parts of the body. The spinal cord is located within the
                            vertebral column and processes some reflexes but primarily transmits
                            information to and from the brain along neurons. Specialized membranes
                            called meninges cover the brain and the spinal cord to
                            protect them. Additionally, a special fluid, called cerebrospinal
                                fluid, chemically and mechanically protects the brain and
                            spinal cord.
