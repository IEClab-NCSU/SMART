Energy and carbon flow through the biosphere in a tightly coupled manner. The
					coupling between energy and carbon is accomplished within an organism through
					the process known as metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of
					all of the metabolic pathways within an organism. A metabolic
							pathway is a series of chemical reactions, each of which is
					catalyzed by an enzyme (protein catalyst). A chemical reaction is a
					chemical change in which new molecules are formed from existing molecules.
					Metabolism builds bigger molecules from smaller ones, and takes molecules apart
					to use the atoms and energy stored in them. The compounds that are internal to a
					metabolic pathway are referred to as intermediates in the
					pathway. A number of pathways, such as those related to energy production, are
					essential to life and are found in all cells. Although specialized cells may
					possess different pathways, there are common characteristics that apply to most
					pathways. These will be covered in the discussion on "Common
						Characteristics of Metabolic Pathways." In the
						Energy module, you will learn about
					adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy
						carrier in cells, and about how energy is transformed and transferred
					during metabolic reactions.
