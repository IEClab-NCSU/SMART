Scientific knowledge is socially and culturally embedded. Science is a human enterprise and is practiced in 
                    the context of the culture at large. The social fabric of a society with its power structures, politics and economy all affect the types 
                    of research conducted by scientists, the way new scientific information is interpreted, and whether or not it is accepted.
