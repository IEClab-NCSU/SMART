To illustrate the connection between information in DNA and an observable characteristic
            of an organism, let’s consider a gene that provides the instructions for building the
            hormone insulin. Insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. The insulin
            gene contains instructions for assembling the protein insulin from individual amino
            acids. Changing the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule can change the amino
            acids in the final protein, leading to protein malfunction. If insulin does not function
            correctly, it might be unable to bind to another protein (insulin receptor). On the
            organismal level of organization, this molecular event (change of DNA sequence) can lead
            to a disease state — in this case, diabetes.
