In eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules are transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
			where proteins are made. RNA that contains instructions for making proteins is called
				messenger RNA (mRNA). The “message” contained in the order of
			bases in the mRNA specifies the order of amino acids in a protein. The process of
			protein synthesis is called translation because the information is
			converted from one chemical form (nucleic acids) to another (amino acids), analogous to
			translation from one language to another.
