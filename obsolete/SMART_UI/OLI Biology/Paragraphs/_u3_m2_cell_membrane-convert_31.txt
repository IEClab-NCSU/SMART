The cell membrane provides a semi-permeable barrier between the inside and the outside of
			the cell. This barrier provides control for transport of nutrients, ions, and signals
			between the highly variable outside environment and the relatively well-defined interior
			of the cell. Here we will explore the ways in which molecules can pass across the
			membrane.
