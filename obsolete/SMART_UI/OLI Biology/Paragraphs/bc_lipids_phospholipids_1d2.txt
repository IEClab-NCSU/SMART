Lipids are essential to life. Phospholipids form the bulk of cell membranes, which define the
					cell. Steroids can be used to help maintain proper membrane fluidity and are
					used as long-distance messenger molecules in some animals. Triglycerides are an
					excellent source of energy storage for organisms. Maintaining proper lipid
					levels is also essential to human health. A deeper understanding of the
					chemistry and physiology of these molecules can help us develop a better
					understanding of ourselves.
