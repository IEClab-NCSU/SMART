If the immune system of an Rh negative person is exposed to Rh positive red blood
                    cells, it will produce antibodies against the Rh molecule. The next time the
                    immune system meets Rh positive red blood cells, the antibodies will attack and
                    destroy them. This scenario is rather unusual, except when a mother who is Rh
                    negative is carrying an Rh positive baby. After the first pregnancy, her immune
                    system develops anti-Rh antibodies, and in subsequent pregnancies these
                    antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the red blood cells of the fetus.
                    This results in hemolytic anemia, and could seriously affect the fetus. Luckily,
                    Rh negative mothers today receive an anti-Rh antibody injection that prevents
                    development of the anti-Rh response.
