Letâ€™s begin with a diploid cell that is 2N = 4. This cell has two copies of each of its
			two chromosomes. During the S phase of interphase, the cell
			replicates its DNA. This results in X-shaped chromosomes that are attached at the
			centromere. The chromosomes have not condensed enough at this point to be visible with a
			microscope. Centrosomes are also formed during interphase. Centrosomes are used to
			identify the poles of the cell during the division process; these poles determine where
			the chromosomes will be sent.
