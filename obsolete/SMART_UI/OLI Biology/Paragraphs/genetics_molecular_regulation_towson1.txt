In this spotlight, we will explore in more detail changes in gene
                expression (transcription) due to changes in the environment. Eukaryotes have
            complex regulatory mechanisms; consequently, we will focus on gene regulation in
            prokaryotes. However, common principles of regulation are used by both prokaryotic and
            eukaryotic organisms, and an understanding of regulation in prokaryotes will help you
            understand eukaryotic regulation in future studies.
