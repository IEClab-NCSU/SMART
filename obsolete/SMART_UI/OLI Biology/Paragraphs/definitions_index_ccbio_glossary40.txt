Relatively large ("macro") molecules made by living organisms from
                                smaller molecular building blocks. There are four classes of
                                biological macromolecules: protiens, lipids, nucleic acids and
                                polysaccharides/complex sugars. For example, starch is a biological
                                macromolecule made by plants from smaller subunits, glucose; all
                                proteins are made of amino acids, and nucleic acids are made from
                                nucleotides.
