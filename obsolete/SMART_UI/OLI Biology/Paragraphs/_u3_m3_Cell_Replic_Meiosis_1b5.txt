An important feature of meiosis is the process called crossing
						over. Crossing over is responsible for generating much of the diversity
					that exists within a species. Remember that diversity in a species is one of the
					hallmark characteristics of living organisms. In future modules, you will see
					that this diversity allows species to survive in changing environmental
					conditions. So, crossing over is another process that brings variability in the
					offspring.
