Viruses create a unique challenge to the definition of life. Viruses show some of the
			characteristics of life, but not all. Viruses contain genetic information in the form of
			either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat for some viruses and a membrane coat for
			others. They lack the machinery for growth and reproduction.
