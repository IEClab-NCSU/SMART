Lucky for us, Earth has an atmosphere comprising gases that make our atmosphere
                    act something like an insulating blanket. The atmosphere is a mixture of many
                    different gases that are held close to Earth’s surface by gravity. The two most
                    abundant gases in the atmosphere are N2,or nitrogen gas (78% of air
                    by volume), and O2, or oxygen gas (21%). These gases are transparent
                    to light and to heat radiation; that is, they do not interfere with sunlight
                    energy coming into Earth or with the heat radiating back into space. Several
                    much less abundant gases, however, do have a major effect on Earth’s energy
                    budget. These greenhouse gases absorb and reemit heat
                    waves (infrared radiation). Three important greenhouse gases are water vapor
                        (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane
                        (CH4). Much of the heat (infrared) radiation that leaves Earth’s
                    surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and reemitted back toward Earth. As a
                    result, these gases retain heat in the atmosphere. Instead of escaping
                    immediately to space, heat is delayed near the Earth’s surface and continues to
                    warm our atmosphere.
