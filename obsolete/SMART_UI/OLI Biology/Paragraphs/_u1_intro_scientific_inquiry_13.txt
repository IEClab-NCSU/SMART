Scientific inquiry has not displaced faith, intuition, and dreams. These
					traditions and ways of knowing have emotional value and provide moral guidance
					to many people. But hunches, feelings, deep convictions, old traditions, or
					dreams cannot be accepted directly as scientifically valid. Instead, science
					limits itself to ideas that can be tested through verifiable observations.
					Supernatural claims that events are caused by ghosts, devils, God, or other
					spiritual entities cannot be tested in this way.
