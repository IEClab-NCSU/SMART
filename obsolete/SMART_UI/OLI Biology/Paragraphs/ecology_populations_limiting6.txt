Other types of limiting factors act more gradually and have their greatest effects when
			populations are crowded. Scarce resources, limited space, and infectious diseases are
			important examples. These factors often play the greatest role in limiting large-bodied
			organisms with extended life spans such as large animals and woody plants. For example,
			deer survive frost well but are more likely to starve in a hard winter if there are many
			mouths to feed. Over time, populations of such species limit
				themselves: they remain close to a stable size called the carrying capacity. When a population is at its carrying capacity, it does not
			tend to increase or decrease but tends to stay essentially the same over many
			generations.
