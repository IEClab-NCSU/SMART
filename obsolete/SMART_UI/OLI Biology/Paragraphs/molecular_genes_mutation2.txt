Errors during DNA replication can have a much longer lasting effect. If incorrect
			nucleotides are incorporated into a newly synthesized DNA strand, the error may be
			passed on to future generations. Such heritable changes are referred to as mutations.
			Some mutations happen due to large scale rearrangements of DNA molecules that involve
			thousands or millions of nucleotides. We will limit our discussion here to small-scale
			changes that involve one or a few nucleotides in the coding sequence of a gene. These
			mutations include substitution of a single nucleotide base and insertion or deletion of
			one or more bases.
