There are two major methods of pathway regulation. The first method involves changing the
			amount of the enzymes in the pathway. Since the reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes,
			if the enzyme is not present, the pathway is effectively shut off. Enzyme levels are
			usually altered by controlling the amount of mRNA produced from the gene that
			encodes the enzyme. You will explore how enzyme levels are regulated in the section on
			transcription.
