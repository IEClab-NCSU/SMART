The hierarchical organization of living systems continues beyond single
					organisms. A population consists of all the individuals of a species living
					within a specific area. For example, a forest may include many pine trees. All
					those pine trees represent the population of pine trees in that forest. As you
					know, many different populations can live in any specific area. All of these
					populations can interact with each other in positive and negative ways, and
					together they form a community. Continuing with our example, the forest with pine trees
					includes populations of flowers, mammals, birds, insects, fungi, and bacteria,
					all of which can interact. These interacting populations make up a community. An
						ecosystem
					consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the
					abiotic, or nonliving, parts of that environment. The pine forest ecosystem
					includes not just plants, animals, and microbes but also rocks, water,
					temperature changes, air chemistry, and other abiotic factors that interact with
					living organisms in the area. Finally, the highest level of organization in
					living systems is the biosphere, which is the collection of all ecosystems on Earth. The
					biosphere includes all habitable zones on the planet, including land, soil, and
					rocks to a great depth in the Earthâ€™s crust; water and ice; and the atmosphere
					to a great height.
