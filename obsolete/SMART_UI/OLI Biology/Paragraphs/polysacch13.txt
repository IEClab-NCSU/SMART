 Glycogen is another example of a homo-polysaccharide of glucose with a repeating structural unit of glucose. For glycogen, there is no linear form, but there is a highly branched form that resembles amylopectin with branch points separated by only 8-10 glucose subunits along the backbone. This creates a much denser, more highly packed structure used for storage of glucose in mammalian cells.
