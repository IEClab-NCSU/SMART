Medical approaches: For the extremely obese, surgical options that
						reduce the size of the stomach are often effective. These procedures may
						work partly by reducing the stomach’s output of ghrelin, thus reducing the
						hunger pangs associated with an empty stomach. Some drugs also show
						promise.
Behavior change: Much research is now exploring how different
						practices — emotional support groups, healthy cooking classes, and more —
						can help obese people make small, sustainable changes to their lifestyles
						for weight control and better health. 
Societal change: Many are trying to reduce obesity by building parks
						and bike lanes, taxing snack foods and sugary sodas, changing school lunch
						menus, expanding physical education classes, posting calorie counts in
						restaurants, and much more. These efforts are meant to change the overall
						social and physical environment to encourage more physical activity and less
						intake of calorie-rich foods.
