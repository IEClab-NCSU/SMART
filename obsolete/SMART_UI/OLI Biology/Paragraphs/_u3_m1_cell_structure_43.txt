The structures shown above are parts of a “generic” eukaryotic cell. While most eukaryotic
				cells will present these structures, variations occur depending on the
			function of the cell. Think about cars — while most cars have the same parts, there will
			be differences between a sedan and an off-road vehicle. Among animal cells, extreme
			examples of specialization include red blood cells (containers of hemoglobin to
			transport oxygen; see picture on the left) and nerve cells (dedicated to transmission
			and integration of signals; picture on the right).
