Consider a short 12 amino acid protein consisting of polar (white) and nonpolar (black)
						amino acids. This polypeptide will fold to bury most of the nonpolar amino
						acids, removing them from contact with water, giving the lowest energy
						state. Other structures are possible, but these will be higher energy (and
						consequently less stable) because they expose more nonpolar amino acid side
						chains to water.
