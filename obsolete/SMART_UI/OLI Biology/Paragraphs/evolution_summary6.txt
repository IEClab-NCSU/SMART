Adaptive traits are those that are favored by natural selection; when we look at life in
            all of its diversity, we encounter amazing adaptations at every turn. Sexually selected
            traits are also very common. Rather than being the toughest, meanest, or even the
            strongest, the organisms with the highest evolutionary fitness are simply those that
            reproduce the most over a lifetime. There are many ways to be fit and adaptive traits
            may shift with changing environments.
