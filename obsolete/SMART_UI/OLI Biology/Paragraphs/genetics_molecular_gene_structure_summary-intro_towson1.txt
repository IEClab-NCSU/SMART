Manipulation of DNA has opened an incredible array of possibilities for humanity.
                    From the industrial production of biological molecules in bacteria, to gene
                    therapy, biotechnology has brought dramatic changes to medicine, agriculture,
                    forensics, and many other disciplines. In this module you revisited how a gene
                    can be inserted and expressed in a bacterium. making possible the large scale
