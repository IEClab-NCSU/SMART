However, even this editing function does not get the error rate to an acceptable number
          for survival of an organism. In addition to editing during synthesis, there is also
          monitoring of the DNA for missed errors resulting from replication and for
          post-replication damage to the DNA. In each of these cases the process involves cutting
          one of the strands of the DNA specifically creating a condition by which a DNA polymerase
          can replace the error or damaged DNA followed by ligation of the nicked DNA using DNA
          ligase. It is to be noted that while different proteins may be used, the basic process is
          the same and follows the direction/rules dictated by the mechanism of the specific
          enzymes. The combination of these other editing and repair functions reduces the error
          rate by another 2 orders of magnitude thus reducing the error frequency to an acceptable
          level.
