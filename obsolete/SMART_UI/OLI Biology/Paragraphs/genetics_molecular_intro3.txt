In the Classical Genetics unit, we considered the mechanisms of inheritance focusing
            mostly on the organism and population levels in the hierarchy of life. In Molecular
            Genetics, we will discuss the molecular basis of traits that characterize the organisms.
            We want to understand on the molecular level how genetic information is organized and
            used by living organisms. First, we will discuss the storage, transmission, and
            expression of genetic information (central dogma of molecular biology) whereby the
            information content in DNA sequences, called genes, are ultimately converted to a
            protein. Then we will look at the structure of genes and genomes as well as the
            interactions between genes and the environment. Finally, weâ€™ll look at how humans are
            able to manipulate genes through biotechnology.
