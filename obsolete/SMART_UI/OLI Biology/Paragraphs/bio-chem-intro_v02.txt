Biology is the study of the living components of the hierarchy. However, an understanding of the chemical foundations of life is essential for 
			understanding how life functions. In this unit (or module) we will start with the atom and the subatomic particles that form the atom and move 
			to a discussion of molecules and the four biologically important macromolecules, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.  Water is a 
			very important molecule in living systems and it has some unique properties that will be discussed.
