First, consider what happens over the course of a typical day. After a meal, extra calories are
			initially stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a complex carbohydrate). Glycogen
			is broken down and used to supply glucose for intense exercise, and to provide glucose
			while we sleep. Breakfast provides fuel to rebuild some of the body’s glycogen stores
			that were depleted overnight. Thus, over short time scales, glycogen storage is an
			efficient way to provide glucose when it’s needed between meals.
