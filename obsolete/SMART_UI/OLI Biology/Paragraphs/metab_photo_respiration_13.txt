 Recently, Iain Stewart, a geoscience professor at Plymouth University, remained in an
				airtight chamber at the Eden Project in Cornwall for 48 hours. The 12 square meter
				(130 square foot) see-through plastic chamber contained between 150 and 200 plants.
				The aim was to demonstrate the importance of plants to human survival as the "lungs
				of the planet."
