 We start with an understanding that the cellular environment is essentially aqueous
			(water) based, and thus, we will begin with a discussion of the chemistry of water as it
			relates to bonding, pH and temperature control. The first two concepts (bonding and pH)
			dictate why molecules are soluble in the cell, in what part of the cell they are
			soluble, what charge molecules will carry and how that charge is controlled by pH.
