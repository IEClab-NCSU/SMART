Molecules like water, oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, and ionic salts like sodium chloride
			are inorganic. Most inorganic substances are relatively stable,
			simple, and store little chemical potential energy. By contrast, organic molecules are often complex and many store a lot of chemical potential
			energy. Examples of organic molecules include glucose, methane, DNA, protein, and fat.
			This unit will focus on organic molecules and the roles these molecules play in living
			organisms.
