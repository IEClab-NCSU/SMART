We are happy you have joined us in our exploration of the fundamental principles
					of biology. Biology is the scientific study of life. Biologists study living
					organisms and the way organisms interact with their environments. The
					understanding gained as a result of biological research has improved our quality
					of life. A prime example of this is the years of biological research that
					resulted in the discovery of antibiotics to help treat bacterial infections.
					Cell biologists are currently researching the causes and symptoms of various
					types of cancers, enabling doctors to find cures and treatments for cancer.
					Ecologists are biologists who specialize in studying the way that living
					organisms interact with their environments. They examine important issues such
					as acid rain and observe what happens to the health of living systems when acid
					rain falls. There are even specialized biologists, called astrobiologists, who
					study conditions on other planets and design experiments to determine whether or
					not life could exist in other places in our solar system.
