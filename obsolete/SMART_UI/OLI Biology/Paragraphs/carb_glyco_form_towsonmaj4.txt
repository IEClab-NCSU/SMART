 This anomeric carbon is the target for the formation of a covalent bond between it and
			potentially any hydroxyl functional group on any other monosacchardie. The covalent bond
			formed between the anomeric carbon and a hydroxyl group is called a glycosidic bond
			and the final structure is referred to as an acetal. The equation for the
			formation of the glycosidic bond is given below. In this reaction, a molecule of water
			is lost during the combining of the two glucose molecules to form the glycosidic bond.
			This type of reaction is referred to as a condensation 
reaction. The reverse of this reaction, requiring the addition of a water
			molecule, is referred to as a hydrolysis reaction. These combined forward and reverse reactions (condensation and
			hydrolysis) form the basis for the creation of most of the covalent assemblies in
			biological systems.
