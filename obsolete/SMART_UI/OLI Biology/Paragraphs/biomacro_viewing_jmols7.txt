Structure of DNA double helix. On the left: Sugar-phosphate backbone is shown
						in yellow, specific bases pairing via hydrogen bonds (red lines) are colored in
						green and purple (A-T pair) and red and blue (C-G). On the right: Three-dimensional
						structure of DNA double helix. Click on the checkboxes to highight the A-T and C-G 
						basepairs. Click on 'Spin On' to automatically rotate the DNA helix structure.
