The numerous organs and structures of the skeletal system allow it to serve an
                    important role in the support and protection of our body. Bones are very strong,
                    yet flexible which makes them perfect for supporting our weight and allowing
                    movement. The connective tissues such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons aid
                    in protecting our joints and providing stability. The red bone marrow inside the
                    bone is vital for hematopoiesis or the production of all blood cells. Bones are
                    also a reservoir for calcium. If your diet is deficient in calcium, a hormone
                    will mobilize calcium from the bones to the blood, and your bones will be
                    weaker.
