Glucose from the outside of the cell is transported across the cell membrane by a
          multi-subunit protein called the glucose transporter. This enzyme catalyzes the diffusion
          of glucose across the membrane without the input of energy. Consequently, spontaneous flow
          of glucose into the cell can only occur if the concentration of glucose is lower in the
          cell than outside the cell. The Gibbs free energy for the transport of glucose is:
