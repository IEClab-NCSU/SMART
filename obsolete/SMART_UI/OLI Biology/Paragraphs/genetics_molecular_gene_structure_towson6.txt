The promoter region of the gene “promotes” transcription by
                binding RNA polymerase.
The terminator region signals the end of transcription.
Regulatory regions before and after the transcribed region bind regulatory proteins.
                These proteins activate or inhibit transcription, depending on the signals from
                within the cell or from the environment.
