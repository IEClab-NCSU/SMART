Several important low-impact technologies are currently in various stages of
                    development. Some examples include renewable electric power (mainly solar and
                    wind power), use of plant and algal biomass as a source of renewable fuel, and
                    improvements in the sustainability of appliances and buildings. In many
                    industries, improvements are occurring gradually through better management
                    practices that reduce waste output, reduce energy and resource use, and reduce
                    harm to the environment. These efforts are often supported by certification
                    systems and ecolabels that help consumers choose lower-impact products. Examples
                    include the Forest Stewardship Council for sustainable forest products, the
                    Marine Stewardship Council for sustainable seafood, LEED certification for
                    sustainable buildings, and the U.S. EPA Energy Star and Water Sense labels for
                    energy- and water-efficient appliances.
