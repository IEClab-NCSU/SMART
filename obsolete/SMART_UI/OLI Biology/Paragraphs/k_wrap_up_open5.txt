A change in the pKa from 5 to a pKa 4 is the change by a
					factor of 10 in the Ka. The table below will help you see the
					relationship between Ka and pKa. The pKa is a
					convenient scale for comparing the dissociation constants of weak acids because
					the pKa scale is similar to the pH scale. The relationship between the two will
					be explained in the next few pages. Remember that the pKa is
					a property of the acidic group while pH is a property of the solution.
