In a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist
			Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like structures he observed when viewing
			cork tissue through a lens. Later, he confirmed van Leeuwenhoek’s 1678 discovery of
			bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses and microscope construction enabled
			other scientists to see some components inside cells.
