Currently, the average citizen of a developed nation consumes an average of 16 tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels, and biomass per year.  Shortages may result if humans use resources at an unsustainable rate.  Wild plants and animals may be harvested to the point of extinction.  Degradation of soil can lead to crop failures.  Minerals and fossil fuels may be depleted to the point where their extraction becomes increasingly expensive and disruptive.
