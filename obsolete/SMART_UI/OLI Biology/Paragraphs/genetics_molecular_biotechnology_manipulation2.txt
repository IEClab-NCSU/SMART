There are hundreds of different restriction enzymes, each of which recognizes and cleaves
            a different DNA sequence or “restriction site”. Examples of two such enzymes are shown
            below. A shorthand notation for the recognition site is given below each name. The “^”
            symbol indicates the site of cleavage. The DNA sequence that they recognize is shown on
            the left and the products of the digestion are shown on the right. The fragments that
            are produced after cleavage can contain single stranded overhangs (e.g. EcoR1) or have
            blunt ends, such as with PvuII.
