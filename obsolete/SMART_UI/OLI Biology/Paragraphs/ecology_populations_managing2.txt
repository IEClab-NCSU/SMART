Management of threatened or endangered species may simply involve increasing birth and
			reducing death rates as much as possible, though this is often easier said than done. To
			help such species, conservationists may breed them in captivity and release individuals
			back into the wild. Captive breeding programs have been used to aid in the recovery of
			many species, including the peregrine falcon and the black-footed ferret. Most
			endangered species management focuses on improving survival rates (reducing death rates)
			by banning harvest of these species or trade in their products, by eliminating
			introduced predators, or by improving habitat conditions.
