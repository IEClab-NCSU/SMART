A similar effect occurs in biological systems. As a protein folds to its final
					three-dimensional structure, the hydrophobic parts of the protein are forced
					together and away from the aqueous environment of the cell. Similarly,
					biological membranes are stabilized by the exclusion of water between layers of
					lipids as we will see later.
