Folk singer Woodie Guthrie suffered from Huntington's disease, which is an autosomal
                dominant disorder caused by a defective allele of the gene coding for a protein
                called huntingtin. The accumulation of the defective huntingtin results in problems
                with muscle coordination and later psychiatric issues and dementia. By Al Aumuller, New York World-Telegram and the Sun (Woody Guthrie) Public Domain
