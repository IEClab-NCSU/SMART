As you have just learned chemistry is important for biology because
							everything is made up of atoms. Atoms combine to form molecules, and
							certain molecules come together in a very specific way to form special
							structures called cells. Cells are the basic unit of life, and
							therefore, the study of cells is essential to biology. After learning
							some chemistry fundamentals, you will explore  the structure and function of cells
							. This figure shows cells (outlined in green) and their
							DNA (stained in blue). The cell in the center is undergoing mitosis, the
							process of cell division.
