The first step in producing HuGH is to generate a synthetic gene whose nucleotide
            sequence codes for the amino acid sequence of the growth hormone. This sequence would
            contain the start codon, codons representing each amino acid in the growth hormone, and
            a stop codon. To do this, the known amino acid sequence for human growth hormone must be
            “back-translated” to a nucleic acid sequence. Since most amino acids can be coded for by
            more than one mRNA codon, this process is ambiguous. Because the genetic code is
            universal it would be possible to use the human codons to encode the sequence of amino
            acids. However, the host organism (which is bacteria in this example) often prefer
            certain codons over others, so the preferred codons must be used to optimize protein
            expression.
