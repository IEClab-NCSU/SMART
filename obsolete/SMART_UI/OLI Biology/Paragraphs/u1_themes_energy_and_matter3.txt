Energy can be defined as
                    the capacity to do work or to make a change in the location, temperature, or
                    structure of matter. Energy does not have mass and it does not take up space,
                    but it can be measured in terms of what it does. Energy comes in many forms,
                    including heat, chemical potential energy, kinetic energy of motion, and light.
                    Energy is required for all organisms to maintain homeostasis, grow, and
                    reproduce.
