Eukaryotic cells contain compartments with specialized functions called
				organelles. Organelles are surrounded by membranes. The nucleus is the
			control center, where the blueprints of all protein products are stored. The nucleus is
			surrounded by a double-membrane called the nuclear envelope, and contains
				chromatin, a protein-DNA complex. When the cell is dividing, chromatin
			condenses and becomes visible as chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of
			chromosomes. 22 pairs are autosomal chromosomes and are numbered 1-22. The other pair is
			referred to as the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one
			X chromosome and one Y chromosome.
