 In the previous module you learned about the inheritance patterns (Mendelian and
            non-Mendelian) that were studied using models such as peas, snapdragons, and dogs.
            Another organism that is often used is the fruit fly Drosophila. Common to these
            organisms is that they are relatively easy to breed and cross under controlled
            conditions. They also have a relatively short lifespan, which allows the tracking of
            traits for many generations. In the case of humans, genetic analysis is much more
            complicated. We live under a variety of conditions, so the environmental influences are
            much stronger. Humans choose their mates freely, families are usually smaller, and our
            lifespan is the same as that of the geneticists. Much information about transmission of
            human traits comes from the study of pedigrees, a chart of genetic connections similar
            to a family tree. In this module, you’ll learn how to read pedigrees. You’ll also look
            at the different patterns and factors that affect human inheritance.
