If one component of an organ system is damaged or malfunctions, the function of the
                organ system will be affected. Think about a broken bone. If the femur breaks, it
                will be much harder to maintain an upright posture, or to walk or run. These might
                also be more difficult if the cartilage of the femur is destroyed by arthritis or a
                ligament in the knee is injured while playing a sport. If any component of the
                skeletal system is damaged—bone, ligament or cartilage—the knee will not function
                properly.
