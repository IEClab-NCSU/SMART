The structure of something is determined by two factors: its three-dimensional shape, and the
			materials from which it is made. The structure that something takes directly influences
			its possible functions. Consider a piece of wood. Depending on how it is shaped, it
			could be used as a spear for hunting, a cup for drinking, a pipe for smoking, or even a
			flute for playing music. The wood also possesses unique properties that influence how it
			can be used. For example, the piece of wood could never function as a hot air balloon,
			no matter what kind of shape it took. It would always be too heavy to lift off the
			ground.
