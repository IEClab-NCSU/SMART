Examine the following image of the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in a single somatic
				cell of a normal human. Notice that there are 22 pairs of chromosomes called
					autosomes and there is one pair of chromosomes called sex
					chromosomes. Males and females have different sex chromosomes. An image
				like this is called a karyotype and can be used to diagnose genetic disorders in
				humans.
