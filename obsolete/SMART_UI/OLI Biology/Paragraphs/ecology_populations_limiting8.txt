A graph of logistic growth shows up as a slightly S-shaped curve. Initial growth is
			relatively slow because the population is small and has few individuals to give birth.
			At moderate population sizes the population grows fastest: there are many parents but
			the effects of crowding are not yet severe. As the population approaches its carrying
			capacity, the effects of crowding start to reduce its growth. The rate of growth slows
			and then stops.
