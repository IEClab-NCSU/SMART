Second, what do we mean by “fittest”? We don’t mean physical fitness. Evolutionary fitness is based on genes and inheritance
					and is measured by lifetime reproductive success. The genes of an organism
					determine many of its features, and these features help determine how likely an
					organism is to reproduce in its particular environment. There are other factors
					at work too, including luck: nature does not line up all the individuals in each
					population and kill them off systematically, leaving only those with the fittest genes to reproduce. Instead, we say that on average the individuals with some phenotypes will
					reproduce better than others in a given environment. These fitter individuals will be more likely to pass on their alleles
					(through reproduction) to the next generation.
