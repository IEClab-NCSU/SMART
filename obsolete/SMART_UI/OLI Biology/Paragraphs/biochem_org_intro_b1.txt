Organic molecules come in all shapes and sizes. One of the key features of organic
			molecules is their modularity: a limited set of monomers can be connected in different
			ways to form a vast array of polymers. It may help to consider an analogy: with a few
			dozen different kinds of Lego bricks, you can make an almost limitless diversity of
			structures. In organic molecules, monomers can be linked together by bonds between
			different atoms, different monomers can be used, and they can be strung together in many
			different arrangements. Therefore organic molecules are virtually limitless in their
			diversity.
