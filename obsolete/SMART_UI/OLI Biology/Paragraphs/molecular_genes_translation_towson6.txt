The genetic code table allows us to convert the information contained in a
					nucleic acid into an amino acid sequence. How does the cell do this during
					translation? Translation from one language to another requires a dictionary, a
					book that connects words in two different languages. In the cell, we need a
					molecule that connects codons and amino acids. That molecule is transfer RNA
					(tRNA). Each tRNA contains three bases that can pair with a particular codon in
					mRNA (complementary base pairing). Each tRNA also carries a specific amino acid.
					The tRNA binds mRNA via base pairing and brings the correct amino acids to the
					growing polypeptide chain.
