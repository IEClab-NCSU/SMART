Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is used to store glucose in both liver and muscle
      cells. In plants, amylopectin serves the same role. Glycogen consists of glucose residues
      linked together in a linear chain with 

-(1-4) linkages. Multiple chains are joined together by the formation of 

-(1-6) linkages, giving rise to a highly branched polymer. The principle reason for
      the storage of glucose as glycogen is to reduce the osmotic effects that would otherwise occur
      from the high concentration of glucose in cells.
