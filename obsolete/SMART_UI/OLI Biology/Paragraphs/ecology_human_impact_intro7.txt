One step toward sustainability is the careful use of renewable
        resources: those that are replenished quickly enough to replace what we
            consume. Resources are renewed through growth or other ongoing processes. Most
            products of plants and animals are potentially renewable, so long as we do not
            consume them too quickly. Many physical processes (solar energy input, river
            flow, tidal flow, wind, flow of heat from Earthâ€™s interior) also occur at a high
            and sustained rate.Nonrenewable resources, by contrast, are replenished very
            slowly. Such a resource can be thought of as a fixed stock. Once depleted, a
            nonrenewable resource cannot be replaced in useful quantities. Most mineral
            resources and fossil fuels are nonrenewable. Over time, if humans continue to
            use these resources they will become increasingly scarce. A second factor in
            sustainability involves the disposal or ultimate fate of materials and wastes we
            produce. Biodegradable materials are more sustainable over
            time because natural decomposition processes will break them down and recycle
            any nutrients they contain. Nonbiodegradable materials tend to accumulate over
            time and may cause negative environmental impacts. Some examples include
            plastics and persistent toxic chemicals.
