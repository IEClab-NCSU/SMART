If all four dNTPs were added at this point simple replication of the strand of DNA would
          occur and no information would be gained. However, if one of the dNTPs was substituted by
          a NTP that had no hydroxyl on either the 2’ or the 3’ position, a dideoxyNTP
          (ddNTP), it would be incorporated into the growing DNA strand through the 5’ position
          in a complementary position opposite its complementary base on the template strand but
          synthesis from that point forward would be terminated due to the absence of a hydroxyl on
          the 3’ position. The requirement for synthesis by DNA polymerase has been lost. The
          dideoxyNTP is referred to as a suicide substrate.
