To fully appreciate an organismâ€™s role in the environment, we must go beyond the web of
			life. We must also consider nonliving, or abiotic, components of the environment: rocks,
			water, gases in the air, chemicals in soil and water, light, temperature, wind, and
			waves. The combination of biotic and abiotic components forms an ecosystem. A community
			is restricted to the populations of living organisms in an area; an ecosystem also
			includes all of the nonliving physical and chemical factors that are important to these
			populations.
