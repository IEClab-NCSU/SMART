The four major classes of biological macromolecules are carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic
					acids, and lipids. These molecules carry out a diverse set of essential
					functions. Carbohydrates are essential for energy storage
					and cellular communication. Nucleic acids (such as DNA)
					are essential for information storage within a cell and passing on this
					information to the next generation. Lipids are essential
					for energy storage and maintaining a boundary between the living organism and
					its environment. Proteins are essential for carrying out
					most of the necessary functions of life.
