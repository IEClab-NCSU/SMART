Enzymes are molecules found within a
			cell that speed up the rate of the chemical reactions necessary to support life. Enzymes
			break down food molecules, help build muscle proteins, can destroy toxins, and much
			more. An enzymeâ€™s ability to function depends directly on its three-dimensional shape.
			If exposed to excessive heat or harsh chemical conditions, enzymes unravel and change
			shape. When this occurs, the enzymes stop working and the chemical reactions of life
			slow down or cease.
