Many proteins bind to small molecules called ligands. Some proteins are enzymes that bind
      small molecules to convert them into other molecules. Some proteins act as transports by
      binding small molecules and ferrying them throughout the organism, or by moving them across
      lipid membranes. Other proteins act as small molecule buffers.
