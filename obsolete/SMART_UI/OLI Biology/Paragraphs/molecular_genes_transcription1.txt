During gene
				expression, information stored in DNA is first copied (or transcribed)
			into RNA in a process called transcription. Only one of the two DNA strands
			is transcribed, and the order of bases in RNA is determined by the base pairing
			of the ribonucleotides with the DNA. In RNA, the base T is absent and U is present
			instead. As you know, A pairs with T, but because T is replaced by U in RNA, A pairs
			with U in RNA. If the transcribed DNA strand has the sequence:
