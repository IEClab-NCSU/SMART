Adenosine diphosphate, or ADP, consists of a single adenosine
                                molecule (composed of an adenine base bound to a ribose sugar)
                                linked to two phosphate ions. Building ATP from ADP is an anabolic
                                reaction that requires catabolic pathways such as cellular
                                respiration.
