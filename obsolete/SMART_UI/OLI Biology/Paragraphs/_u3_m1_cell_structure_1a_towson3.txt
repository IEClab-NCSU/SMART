There are several parts (referred to as structures)
					common to all cells regardless of the cell type. All cells are surrounded by a
					cell membrane. The cell membrane provides a barrier
					between the interior and exterior of the cell and it regulates the flow of
					substances in and out of the cell. All cells also have
							cytoplasm, which is the fluid that occupies the
					space inside the cell. Cytoplasm is the space in which the chemical reactions
					that enable life take place. All cells also contain DNA,
					which is often called the “master molecule” of the cell because it contains the
					instructions for synthesizing all of the cell’s proteins. As you already know,
							proteins are the raw materials used to build many
					important structures in living systems. Finally, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
					contain ribosomes. Ribosomes are the molecular machines
					that use the instructions contained in the DNA to build all the proteins needed
					by the cell.
