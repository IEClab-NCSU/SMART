Evolution can be divided into two levels: microevolution and macroevolution.
                Microevolution is a process that occurs within a single population as
            inherited traits become more or less common from one generation to the next. It is a
            change in the genetic makeup of a population. Natural selection is the main process of
            microevolution; it shapes populations such that they become better-adapted to local
            conditions over time. For bacteria, viruses, insects, weeds, birds, small fish, and
            other species with short generation times, we can sometimes directly observe
            microevolution over periods of a few years or less.
