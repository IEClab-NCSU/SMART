Why do cells divide? In the discussion about the cell cycle, you learned that
					cells undergo different phases, during which they grow, duplicate their genetic
					material, and then divide. In unicellular species, cell division results in the
					reproduction of the entire organism. However, cell division in multicellular
					species can serve two main purposes. Cells can divide into identical daughter
					cells, enabling growth and repair, or gametes can be formed for use in
					sexual reproduction.
