All cells share a similar chemistry. Cells consist of an aqueous solution, containing
                    ions and small organic molecules, larger macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins,
                    and nucleic acids, and closed compartments defined by lipid membranes. We first
                    discussed how some atoms will form ions in water while others, in particular carbon,
                    nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, form covalent bonds with each other in organic
                    chemicals. Two important small organic molecules that you should be familiar with are
                    the carbohydrate glucose and the nucleic acid ATP. Can you describe the role of ATP and glucose in biology?
