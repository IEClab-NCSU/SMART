A phylogenetic perspective can help us deal with threats. When there is an outbreak of
            food poisoning, genetic analysis can show that the harmful bacteria came from a
            particular farm. If we are attacked by a new virus, we can compare its genes to those of
            known pathogens. Once we place the virus within a clade, we can quickly get a handle on
            what weâ€™re facing, how it is likely to affect us, and how we can best combat it.
