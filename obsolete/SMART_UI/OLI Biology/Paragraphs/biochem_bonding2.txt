Chemical bonds are attractions between atoms that hold atoms and molecules together. There are
			three types of chemical bonds that are important in biology: covalent bonds, ionic
			bonds, and hydrogen bonds. Covalent bonds are very stable, while ionic and hydrogen bonds are less
			stable. The relatively weaker ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds allow reversible interactions between different molecules in
			biological systems.
