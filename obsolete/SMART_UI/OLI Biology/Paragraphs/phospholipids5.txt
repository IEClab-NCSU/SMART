To construct a fat, or triacylglycerol, three fatty acid molecules are
							attached to the glycerol through an ester bond between the carboxyl
							group of the fatty acids and the three alcohol groups of a glycerol
							molecule. This is another example of a condensation reaction that
							results in formation of an ester in this case and the release of a water
							molecule. A fat molecule can be composed of one, two, or three different
							types of fatty acids each of which can be saturated or unsaturated.
