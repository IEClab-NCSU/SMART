Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are regulated at two levels. First, at the cellular level, the regulatory enzymes are sensitive to the energy levels of the cell.  Second, at the organ level, the enzymes are regulated by hormones.  However, unlike glycogen metabolism, this regulation is not via protein phosphorylation but by changes in levels of the allosteric regulatory compound fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (F26P).  The levels of F26P are indirectly regulated by hormones by virtue of the fact that the activity of the enzymes that make and degrade F26P are a affected by protein phosphorylation.
