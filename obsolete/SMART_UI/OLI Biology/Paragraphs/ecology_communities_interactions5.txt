Predation can be broadly defined as any win-lose interaction,
			though it is most commonly used to describe situations where one species kills and eats
			another. You are no doubt familiar with many spectacular examples, as when a pack of
			wolves takes down a moose. More subtle examples of predation also exist. Sometimes the
			predator will eat only part of the prey, allowing it to live another day. Though we
			often use the term “herbivory” for the consumption of plants, the moose
			might itself be considered a predator if it harms the plants on which it feeds. Many
			forms of predation involve symbiosis. Such interactions are called parasitism 
			and may involve animal or a plant hosts that provide both habitat and food to
			their harmful symbionts.
