In the diagram "Overview of the Cell Cycle" above, look closely at the parent cell and
			the two daughter cells. Notice that they look the same. Once again, we revisit the theme
			of cycles in nature that we discussed above. The cycle generates cells that resemble the
			cells we started with. In addition, the new cells undergo the same
			development-and-division process that their parental cell did. For these two reasons, we
			call this the cell cycle, and draw it like a circle. Similarly, human beings have
			children, who then have children themselves. (You may have heard this called the circle
			of life.) Cells do the same thing through the cell cycle. The following diagram shows
			the cell cycle in circular form.
