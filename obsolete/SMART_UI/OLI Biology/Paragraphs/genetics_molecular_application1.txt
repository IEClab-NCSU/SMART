Much of our DNA contains a number of short DNA segments that are repeated over and over
            again at different locations in our genome. The number of these tandem repeats at each
            location in the genome can differ from individual to individual, with 5 to 20 percent of
            individuals having the same number of tandem repeats at the same location.
