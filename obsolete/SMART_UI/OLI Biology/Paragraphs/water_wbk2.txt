 Water is the solvent of life on Earth. It has several properties that contribute
					to its suitability to support life as we know it. One property derived from the
					special properties of oxygen is that water is a polar 
molecule. Oxygen is electronegative and draws the electrons that it
					shares in the covalent bond with hydrogen towards itself.
