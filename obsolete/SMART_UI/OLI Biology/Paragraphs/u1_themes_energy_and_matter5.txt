In biology, chemical potential energy is a key form of
                    energy. It is measured in units called calories. When we’re talking about
                    energy, we’ll say “the calories stored in ...” or “the chemical potential energy
                    of ...” a substance. We are talking about what the substance can do if it is put
                    through a chemical reaction, like burning, that will release its stored energy.
                    Returning to the breakfast cereal example, nutrition labels indicate the
                    chemical potential energy of food by listing the calories per serving.
