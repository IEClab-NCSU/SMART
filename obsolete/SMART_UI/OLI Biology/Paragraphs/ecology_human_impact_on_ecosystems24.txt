Changes in seasonal patterns of life. As the climate warms,
                    springtime events—leaf emergence and flowering, nesting and migration of birds,
                    etc.—are occurring at earlier dates than in the past. A 2003 study reviewed data
                    from studies on 172 different species of plants, birds, butterflies, and
                    amphibians and found that springtime events had shifted toward earlier dates by
                    an average of 2.3 days per ten years; most of the studies extended over a period
                    of about 50 years. Such shifts can disrupt community interactions, particularly
                    since some species respond more quickly than others to changes in climate.
                    Studies have found that some birds arrive at summer breeding grounds only to
                    find that their prey (insects) have already completed their life cycles.
                    Similarly, some butterfly species are in trouble because their food plants are
                    developing tough leaves and beginning to wither earlier in the season, before
                    the caterpillars have hatched. To learn more about how butterflies are
                    responding to climate changes view the video in the “Changing Planet” series by
