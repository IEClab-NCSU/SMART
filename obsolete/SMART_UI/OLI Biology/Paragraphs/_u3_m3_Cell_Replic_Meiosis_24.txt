Crossing over during prophase 1: crossing over introduces novel combinations of
				traits among offspring.
Segregation of chromosomes into gametes: the maternal and the paternal copy of each
				chromosome pair will segregate to different gametes. However, which goes to which
				cell is a random process. Thus, the possible number of combinations is astounding:
				in the case of humans, with 23 chromosomes, it is 223 (8,388,608).
