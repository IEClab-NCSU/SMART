In 2001, President George W. Bush instituted strict guidelines for federal funding of scientific research on hESCs. This policy required scientists
                        essentially to halt the harvesting of hESCs for research and use only existing stem cell lines in their research. The policy slowed hESC research 
                        but catalyzed the discovery of iPSCsfrom adult cells. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order revoking Bush’s guidelines, which 
                        allowed scientists once again to pursue federal funding for research on hESCs, but only cell lines derived from unused embryos from fertility clinics.
