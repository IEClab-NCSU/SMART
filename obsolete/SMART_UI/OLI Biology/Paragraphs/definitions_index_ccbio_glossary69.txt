Tightly coiled form of the DNA-protein complex. A thread-like
                                structure of nucleic acids carrying genetic information in the form
                                of genes. Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell
                                and in the nucleoid region of a prokaryotic cell.
