Cellular respiration is a key pathway in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.
					On the macro scale, respiration refers to breathing: taking in oxygen and
					removing CO2. But ultimately, the reason we need to breathe is to
					provide the oxygen needed to carry out cellular respiration in our cells and to
					remove the carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct.
