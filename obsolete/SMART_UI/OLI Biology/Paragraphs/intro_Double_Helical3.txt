This representation of the ladder of a double stranded DNA is illustrated in the figure below on the left side. However, this secondary structure spontaneously forms a double helical coiled structure that is depicted on the right hand side of the figure below. This structure has several distinct features that characterize the dominant structure called B-DNA.
