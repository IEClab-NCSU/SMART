Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are interdependent metabolic pathways. The
            products of cellular respiration (water and carbon dioxide) are the precursors that feed
            into photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis (oxygen and glucose) are the
            precursors that feed into cellular respiration. This interdependence is an excellent
            illustration of how anabolic and catabolic reactions are also interdependent. Anabolic
            reactions use energy to build complex molecules, while catabolic reactions harvest the
            energy stored in the complex molecules by breaking them down into simple precursors.
            Catabolic reactions produce the energy required for anabolic reactions. In the next
            module, weâ€™ll look at how metabolic pathways are regulated.
