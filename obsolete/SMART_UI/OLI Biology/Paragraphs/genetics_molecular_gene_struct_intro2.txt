In this module, we will explore the connection between DNA and phenotype on the molecular
            level. We will start by clarifying the distinctions between genes, genomes, alleles, and
            other related terms. We will compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes and genomes, and
            we will look at how DNA is packaged into chromosomes with the help of specialized
            proteins. We will consider how gene expression can be regulated in the cell by
            interactions with other genes and environment.
