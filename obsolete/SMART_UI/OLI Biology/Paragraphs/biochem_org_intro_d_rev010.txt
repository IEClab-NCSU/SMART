Charged functional groups are acids, meaning that they form
						ions by
					the release of hydrogen ions (H+), which are also called protons. Depending on the
					specific functional group, these groups of molecules lose a hydrogen ion (or deprotonate) and become either charged or neutral as a
					result. Charged functional groups play key roles in biological systems. For
					example, amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, consists of an
						amino group bonded to a carboxylic acid group.
					Many proteins bind to DNA (or RNA) by
					utilizing the electrostatic interaction between positive charges on the protein
					and negative charges on the DNA or RNA. Note that when these groups are in their
					uncharged state, they can be considered to be polar functional groups.
