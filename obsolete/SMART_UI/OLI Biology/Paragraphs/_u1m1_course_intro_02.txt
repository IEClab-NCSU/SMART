Life is everywhere. Biologists study the human body and figure out how it works when it
			is healthy, and compare that to the way it works when things go wrong. They study the
			bacteria that live in your digestive system and explore the reasons why these bacteria
			are critical to your health. They study mice and flies and yeast and plants and learn
			about how living organisms are alike, and how they are different.
