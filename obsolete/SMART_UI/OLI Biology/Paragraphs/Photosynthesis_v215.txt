Jean-Baptist van Helmontâ€™s experiment shows that the carbon needed for photosynthesis does not come from the soil. It does not show where the carbon does come from. A number of other studies conducted by scientists over many decades were required to show where the carbon comes from. Today, we know that CO2 is the source of carbon for photosynthesis.
