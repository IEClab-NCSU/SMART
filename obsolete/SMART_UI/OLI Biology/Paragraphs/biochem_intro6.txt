Biology is the study of the living components of the hierarchy. However, an understanding
			of the chemical foundations of life is essential for understanding how life functions.
			In this unit we will start with the atom and the subatomic particles that form the atom
			and move to a discussion of molecules and the four biologically important
			macromolecules, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. We will also discuss
			water as it has unique properties and is a very important molecule in living systems.
