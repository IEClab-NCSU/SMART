There are two general forms of endocytosis: phagocytosis and
				pinocytosis. Phagocytosis is the uptake of large solid
			particles such as bacteria or cellular debris. Pinocytosis is the uptake of
			fluid and any small molecules dissolved within it. Cells are also capable of recognizing
			specific particles and engulfing them in a more targeted way, a process called
			receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this case, the particle first binds to a membrane
			protein receptor on the surface of the cell. Binding of the target particle induces the
			cell to engulf it.
