We sometimes refer to organisms’ adaptive traits as “adaptations.” We also use the word
            “adaptation” as a verb, to describe the process of evolution that occurs over many
            generations of natural selection. In the White Sands National Monument, we see the
            outcome of past evolution - three different species of lizard all have “bleached” color
            forms that inhabit the white-sand dunes. But we can also see evidence of ongoing
            evolution. Within two of the three species, lizards of both color forms coexist around
            the edges of the White Sands and there is a gradual shift toward darker color patterns
            as one moves into the surrounding (brown-soiled) desert. In some areas there is
            noticeable variation; both color forms are present. No doubt there is ongoing selection
            as predators continue to hunt lizards, generation after generation. Although the lizards
            move around and breed with each other, natural selection maintains dark color types in
            dark habitats and “bleached” color forms in the White Sands.
