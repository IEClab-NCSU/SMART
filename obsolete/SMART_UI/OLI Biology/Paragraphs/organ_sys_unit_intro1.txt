 In the Genetics unit,
            you learned about the mechanisms of inheritance, focusing mostly on the organism and
            population levels in the hierarchy of
                life. In the Molecular Genetics unit, you learned about the
            molecular basis of traits that characterize the organisms and how genetic information is
            organized and used by living organisms at the molecular level.
