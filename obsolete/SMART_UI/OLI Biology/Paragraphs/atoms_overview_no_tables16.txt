 As you can see in the periodic table these atoms are found on the extreme right
					or the extreme left of the periodic table. For example, chlorine is on the right
					of the periodic table and is extremely electronegative and, thus, wants to
					acquire an electron, whereas, sodium on the extreme left of the periodic table
					wants to give up its unpaired electron. By losing an electron, sodium becomes a
					positively charged cation and by gaining an electron, chlorine becomes
					a negatively charged anion. These charged atoms are called
						ions and form the basis for charge repulsion and attraction in the
					non-covalent ionic bond. The affinity of Na+ for Cl- is a
						non-covalent, ionic bond (the attraction of opposite charges).
