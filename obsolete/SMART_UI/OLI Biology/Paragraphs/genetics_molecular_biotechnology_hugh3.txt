The synthetic gene provides the information that specifies the order of the amino acids
            in HuGH. The expression plasmid is a large closed circular piece of DNA. Various DNA
            sequences on the expression plasmid are required for maintenance of the plasmid in the
            cells. These sequences are present on all plasmids, regardless of the type of protein
            that is being made. The plasmid also contains DNA sequences (promoter for RNA
            polymerase, lac operator) that are required for the production of the mRNA that encodes
            HuGH. The bacterial cell provides the protein synthesizing machinery so that the mRNA
            can be translated to a protein. In order for the protein to be correctly made the mRNA
            must contain a ribosome binding site, a start codon, and a stop codon.
