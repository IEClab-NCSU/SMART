In the process of selecting for desired traits, undesirable traits often “tag
					along”, and thus we see an increased likelihood of genetic disorders in many
					domestic animals. This is a result of inbreeding (mating of individuals that are
					closely related). For example, inbreeding among dalmatians has resulted in a
					tendency toward aggressive behavior. Additionally, sometimes selective breeding
					can magnify a desired trait to such an extreme that it interferes with survival
					or reproduction. American domestic turkeys have been bred to have larger breast
					muscles to satisfy consumers’ preference for white meat. As a result of
					generations of selective breeding, today’s male turkeys are literally too
					large-chested to mount and copulate with female turkeys. To produce more
					turkeys, farmers must artificially inseminate females. In this and other
					examples, selective breeding can produce plant and animal varieties that are
					totally dependent on our care and intervention, exhibiting traits that would
					never be adaptive in the wild.
