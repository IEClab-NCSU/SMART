The process of DNA replication is catalyzed by a type of enzyme called
                DNA polymerase (poly meaning many, mer meaning pieces, and ase meaning
            enzyme; so an enzyme that attaches many pieces of DNA). Observe the figure below: the
            double helix of the original DNA molecule separates (blue) and new strands are made to
            match the separated strands. The result will be two DNA molecules, each containing an
            old and a new strand. Therefore, DNA replication is called
            semiconservative. The term semiconservative refers to the fact
            that half of the original molecule (one of the two strands in the double helix) is
            “conserved” in the new molecule. The original strand is referred to as the template strand because it provides the information, or template,
            for the newly synthesized strand.
