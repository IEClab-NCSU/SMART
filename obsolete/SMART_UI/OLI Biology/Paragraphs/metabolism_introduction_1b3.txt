Many microorganisms, such as yeast, can utilize the energy stored in glucose in
					the absence of oxygen (anaerobic growth); the most common form of this process
					is fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, yeasts still produce ATP
					by the partial oxidation of glucose, releasing smaller amounts of
					CO2. The remaining carbon atoms in the glucose are converted to
					ethanol. The energy stored in ethanol can be used as fuel for our internal
					combustion engines. Humans also undergo anaerobic metabolism during vigorous
					exercise, but in humans, lactic acid is produced instead of ethanol. When
					sufficient oxygen becomes available, the carbon atoms in lactate are converted
					to CO2. Other organisms that perform fermentation produce a variety
					of other end products. Fermentation is discussed as an alternative pathway in
					the module on Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration.
