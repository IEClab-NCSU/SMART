Some elements readily take on one or more extra electrons. They become anions
					that carry a negative charge, because they have more electrons than protons. On
					the periodic table, elements to the right (with the exception of the last
					column) are likely to take on extra electrons. For example, chlorine (Cl) has
					seven electrons in its valence shell. It is likely to take on one extra electron
					to fill its outer shell, becoming an anion with a charge of -1. The same can be
					said for other elements in the same column with chlorine. Conversely, elements
					on the left side of the periodic table tend to give up one or more electrons and
					become cations with a positive net charge. For example, sodium (Na)
					has one electron in its valence shell. It readily gives up this electron,
					becoming a cation with a charge of +1. The same can be said for lithium (Li) and
					other elements in this column.
