The cell wall is a porous structure that protects, supports, and
			gives shape to the cell. The plant cell wall is different from that of prokaryotes, and
			it is mainly formed by polysaccharides, particularly cellulose.
			Plant cells can also have a central vacuole, which can be a place
			of storage, degradation, defense, and even physical support for the cell. Even though
			plants have a cell wall, this does not mean they donâ€™t have a cell membrane. All cells
			have a cell membrane. Some, like plant cells, just have a cell
			wall as well.
