The nature of polar molecules is that they contain electronegative atoms,
					consequently they are capable of hydrogen bonding with aqueous or polar
					solvents. Because polar molecules are generally water soluble, they are referred
					to as being hydrophilic, or water-loving. The one-carbon alcohol,
					methanol, is an example of a polar molecule.
