 The major difference in the polymer backbones between DNA and RNA is the sugar used in
          the formation of the polymer. In DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid)
          the sugar is the aldose deoxyribose with a hydrogen replacing the hydroxyl at the 2
          position of ribose, a furanose. In RNA (RiboNuceic Acid), the
          sugar is the monosaccharide ribose in the furanose conformation.
