Human beings are living organisms and understanding the principles of biology
					helps us to better understand ourselves and the world around us. The
					understanding gained as a result of biological research has improved our quality
					of life. For example, it was years of biological research that resulted in the
					discovery of antibiotics to help treat bacterial infections. Cell biologists are
					currently researching the causes and symptoms of various types of cancers and
					this research enables doctors to find cures and treatments for cancer. In this
					way, biology helps to keep us well and is the foundation for modern
					medicine.
