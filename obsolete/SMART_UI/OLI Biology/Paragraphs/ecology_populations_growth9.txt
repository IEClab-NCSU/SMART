The population is projected to grow at a constant annual rate of increase (0.39 deer
			added per deer per year, or 39% annual growth). Each year, the starting N is updated to reflect the growth of the previous year. For
			example, the starting population for 1986 (236) = the base population from 1985 (170)
			plus the growth from 1985 (66). Although the per capita rate of
			growth remains constant, the number added each year increases with the base
			population.
