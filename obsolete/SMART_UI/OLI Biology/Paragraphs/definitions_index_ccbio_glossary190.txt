 Two atoms with the same atomic number (because they are the same
                                element and have the same number of protons), but different atomic
                                mass (because they have different numbers of neutrons). Carbon-12
                                (the number after the hyphen, 12 in this example, indicates the
                                atomic mass), which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and Carbon-13,
                                which has 6 protons and 7 neutrons are two isotopes of carbon.
