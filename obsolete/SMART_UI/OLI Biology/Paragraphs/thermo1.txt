Pathways accomplish the net conversion of the starting compounds to the final product of
          the pathway. During the normal operation of a pathway there is a constant flux of material
          through the pathway in one direction. Note that many pathways are reversible and operate
          in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the needs of the organism. The direction
          of a pathway depends on the energy difference between the starting compounds and final
          product of the pathway. The pathway will be spontaneous in the direction that causes a
          decrease in the free energy of the system. Reversing the direction of a pathway
          requires changing the relative energies of the reactants and products
