We began with a study of population ecology. Population size and density increase with
            birth or immigration and decrease with death and emigration. Populations tend to
            increase if provided with good living conditions. Exponential growth occurs if the per
            capita rate of increase remains constant; the bigger the population gets, the faster it
            grows. Real populations face limiting factors that increase the death rate or decrease
            the birth rate. If these factors intensify as a population becomes crowded, the result
            is logistic population growth that levels off at a populationâ€™s carrying capacity.
            Humans apply principles of population ecology in managing populations of endangered
            species, fish, game animals, pests, and more.
