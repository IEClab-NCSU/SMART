Pure water is said to be “neutral” (neither acidic nor basic) because it has equal
			concentrations of H+ and OH-. When some compounds are dissolved
			into water, they disturb this balance. Some compounds release extra hydrogen ions
				(H+) into the solution. These compounds are called acids. Other compounds
			remove hydrogen ions (H+) from the solution when they are combined with
			water. These compounds are called bases. Some bases accept H+ directly, but
			others release hydroxide ions (OH-) that then combine with H+ to
			produce water. The end result is the same. When the base is dissolved in water, the
			concentration of H+ ions goes down. A compound that does not result in a net
			gain or loss of hydrogen ions (H+) when in aqueous solution is said to be
			neutral, it does not alter the acidity of the water.
