Recently, research has found that a number of mRNA sequences undergo what is referred to as alternative-splicing. If normal splicing is from the 3’ end of one exon and the 5’ end of the immediately following exon, imagine the number of possible splices that could occur if the 3’ end of the exon could be joined to the 5’ end of any exon downstream from the first exon. For example, if an mRNA had three exons, 1, 2, and 3 in order, and two introns, the normal sequence of splicing would link exon 1 to exon 2 to exon 3. But it would be possible to link exon 1 to exon 3 to create a “new” protein with only two of the three exons. This allows a single gene with multiple exons to represent many different proteins. Errors in splicing have also been found to be the cause of certain diseases.
