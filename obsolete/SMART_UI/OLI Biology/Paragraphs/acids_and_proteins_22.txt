Proteins are macromolecules built from amino acids. There are many
					different types of proteins, and each type has a special function to perform in
					living organisms. This specialized function is determined largely by the types
					of amino acids that are in the protein. There are 20 different amino acids that
					can be joined in a myriad of ways to produce molecules with an enormous
					variety of possible structures that can perform a huge number of critical
					cellular functions. The following list represents just a sampling of the many
					things proteins can do in living systems.
