There are two types of sex chromosomes — X and Y. The X chromosome is large and carries
            many genes
            unrelated to sex. The Y chromosome, on the other hand, is much smaller and carries only
            the genes containing the instructions for “maleness,” which are molecular signals that
            instruct the fetal gonads (sex organs) to develop as testes and not ovaries. In the
            absence of the Y chromosome, a fetus develops as female.
