Many human traits are clear-cut and easy to test. These include the ability to bend back
            the thumb nearly 90 degrees (known as “hitchhiker’s thumb”), to roll the tongue into a
            U-shape, and to taste a bitter chemical called phenylthiocarbamide. While these traits
            do not have considerable implications on human health and species survival, many others
            do. Some of them are related to disorders such as sickle cell anemia, hemophilia,
            Tay-Sachs disease, and Down syndrome, to name a few.
