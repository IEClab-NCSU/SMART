DNA carries the
            information about how proteins are built, and proteins carry out many of the reactions
            necessary for living organisms. The 
                Proteins module discussed the variety of roles proteins can play in
            a living organism. Some proteins produced by living organisms determine the traits we
            can observe. These visible traits are called the phenotype of an
            organism.
