Ecological interactions range from harmful to helpful and can take on many forms. Some
			interactions involve exchanges of materials; others are more subtle and involve services
			or behaviors. Mutualistic interactions often develop when two partners have
			complementary abilities. For example, aphids are excellent plant sap drillers but ants
			are much tougher and more mobile, so the trade between aphid and ant is quite logical.
			Predation is a nearly universal interaction: almost every organism is food for something
			else, and most animals eat living prey of some kind. Competition often develops where
			individuals or species have similar requirements, like the plants that will crowd
			together in a dense Alabama thicket if conditions permit it.
