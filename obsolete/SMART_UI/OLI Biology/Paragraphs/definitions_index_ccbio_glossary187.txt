 An atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons
                                and consequently has a positive or a negative charge. Negatively
                                charged ions, called anions, form when a
                                neutral molecule or atom gains one or more electrons. Positively
                                charged ions, called cations, form when a
                                neutral molecule or atom looses one or more electrons.
