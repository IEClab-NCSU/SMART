Although many factors stabilize the final shape of a protein, the most
					importantfact is the hydrophobic effect. Amino acids with non-polar
					(hydrophobic) sidechains are driven into the central core of the protein because
					they are repelled by the water. This is known as the hydrophobic effect and it
					results in proteins that have amino acids with hydrophilic sidechains on the
					surface of the protein. The folded protein reaches the lowest energy state,
					which is the most stable, by folding in a way to optimize the burial of
					non-polar amino acid sidechains while still leaving the polar groups on the
					surface. Therefore, the shape of the folded form of the protein depends on the
					order of hydrophobic amino acids in the protein.
