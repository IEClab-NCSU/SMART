The organization of the genetic information on the chromosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is different. In each case, as indicated below, the sequence for initiation of transcription is the Promoter and the sequence signaling the end of transcription is the Terminator. However, in eukaryotes there is generally one gene that codes for one product under the control of a single promoter. In contrast, prokaryotes generally have multiple genes, each coding for a separate product, under the control of a single promoter. This unit of a promoter, a terminator and the intervening gene or genes is called an Operon. The operon also contains the controlling elements for the operon. The control of expression of an operon is the topic for a separate unit.
