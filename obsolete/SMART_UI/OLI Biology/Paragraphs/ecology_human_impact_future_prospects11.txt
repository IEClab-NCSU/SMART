Climate change mitigation is the
                    effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases or increase the rate at which
                    they are removed from the air, thereby slowing the pace and reducing the
                    severity of climate change. Some of the actions that could be taken to
                    accomplish this include energy conservation, widespread adoption of renewable
                    energy technologies, increased use of nuclear power, switching from coal to
                    natural gas, and capture and storage of CO2 from coal-burning power
                    plants. We can also work to increase the extent and growth of carbon-absorbing
                    forests. Changes to agriculture and waste disposal practices could help reduce
                    emissions of methane and nitrous oxides. At a fundamental level, efforts to slow
                    population growth may mitigate climate change simply by reducing population
                    growth, which is a key underlying factor driving all human impacts on the
                    environment.
