 If 

G less than 0 then the reaction is not at equilibrium and will proceed
            spontaneously in the forward direction, A to B.
 If 

G greater than 0 then the reaction is also not at equilibrium, but will proceed
            spontaneously in the reverse direction, B to A.
 If 

G=0 the reaction is at equilibrium and the concentrations of reactants and
            products will not change.
