The TCA cycle is regulated by energy sensing.  When the levels of the high energy compounds ATP or NADH become elevated the TCA cycle halts - there is no need for the cell to produce energy.  Under these conditions, any excess acetyl-CoA is stored as fat, regardless of the source of the acetyl-CoA.  The ingestion of excess amounts of proteins or carbohydrates result in the generation of fat.
