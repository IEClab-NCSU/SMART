The Gibbs free energy consists of two terms. The first indicates the energy change due to
          the difference of proton concentration across the membrane. Its form is analogous to the
          formula give for the transport of glucose across the membrane in glycolysis. The second
          term accounts for the fact that the energy of a charged particle depends on the voltage.
          If there is a voltage difference across the membrane then the energy of the proton will
          depend on its location.
