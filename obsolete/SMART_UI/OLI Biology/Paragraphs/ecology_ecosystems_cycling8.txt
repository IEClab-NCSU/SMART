Carbon is cycled through a variety of biological and physical processes.  Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; aerobic respiration by living plants and animals returns carbon to the air.  Decomposition, a combination of aerobic respiration and fermentation carried out by microbes, takes carbon from dead material and returns it to the atmosphere.  In the much longer term, geologic processes store carbon in fossil fuels and in rocks such as limestone.  This stored carbon is slowly returned to active circulation by erosion of rock and by volcanic eruptions.
