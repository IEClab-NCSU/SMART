Extinction is a naturally occurring process; thousands of species known only from
                    fossils attest to that fact. However, current rates of endangerment and
                    extinction are much faster than those estimated from a study of the fossil
                    record. Today, the vast majority of extinctions can be clearly attributed to the
                    environmental impacts generated by human activities. The major causes of
                    extinction can be categorized as follows:
