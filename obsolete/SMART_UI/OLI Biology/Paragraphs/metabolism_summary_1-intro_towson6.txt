Photosynthesis and cellular respiration create a cycle
			of materials and enable the flow of energy to most life on Earth. Living organisms that
			do not do photosynthesis indirectly depend on the sun as the ultimate source of energy,
			because they derive their energy from food that is biological in origin. Although
			consumers may eat each other, the energy in organic matter can eventually be traced back
			to photosynthetic producers. In addition, the oxygen generated as a waste product by
			photosynthesis is a vital input to cellular respiration.
