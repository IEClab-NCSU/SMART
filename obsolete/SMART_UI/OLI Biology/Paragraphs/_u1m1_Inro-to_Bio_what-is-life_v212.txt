Viruses are very specific to a particular host cell. Proteins on the
							surface of the virus recognize proteins on the surface of cells. Viruses
							only infect cells with the proper proteins. 
Viruses mutate rapidly. This is one of the reasons that we need new flu
							vaccines each year. The flu is caused by a virus, and the flu vaccine
							helps the body recognize and defend against the current flu virus. By
							next year, the virus has changed so much, that our current immunizations
							no longer protect against the new virus. For similar reasons, AIDS drugs
							are changed periodically. If the same drug is used for a long time, the
							HIV viruses in the patientâ€™s body evolve resistance to this drug.
