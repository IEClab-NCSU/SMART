Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide; that is, an organic
                                molecule that acts as the direct energy source for almost all
                                cellular activities. It consists of a single adenosine molecule
                                (composed of the base adenine bound to a ribose sugar), linked to
                                three phosphate ions. It is however a relatively unstable molecule;
                                consequently, it is never used for the long-term storage of energy
                                in the cell. ATP is specialized for direct and rapid transfers of
                                energy.
