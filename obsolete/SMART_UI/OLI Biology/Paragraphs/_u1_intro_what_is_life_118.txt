Antibiotics are substances that are produced by one type of organism (usually
					bacteria or mold) and used to kill or suppress other organisms (usually
					bacteria). Antibiotics have a very specific way of working called their “mode of
					action.” Penicillin works by interfering with cell wall construction in
					bacterial cells. The cell wall is a somewhat rigid “shell” that encloses a
					bacterial cell. In the presence of penicillin, a bacterium’s cell wall cannot be
					built (or rebuilt) and the cell wall eventually collapses, killing the cell.
					Cell walls are not present around human cells, or those of any other animal.
					Therefore penicillin does not harm our cells - only those of bacteria. This is a
					general feature of antibiotics. When taken in prescribed doses, antibiotics are
					usually harmless to humans.
