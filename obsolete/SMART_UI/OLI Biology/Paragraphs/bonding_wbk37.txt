 When NaCl dissolves in water, each atom becomes surrounded by at least 20 water
					molecules. As NaCl there is 5 kcal/mol of energy associated with the ionic
					attraction of the cation and anion, but when a Na ion is surrounded by 20 water
					molecules, there is 100 kcal/mol of energy associated with just the Na ion.
					Thus, NaCl in an aqueous solution is energetically more favored than NaCl as the
					ionically bonded molecule due to the resulting hydrated state. You will explore
					what happens to molecules that only partially dissociate, or weak electrolytes,
					in water in the next module.
