The midpoint of the transition from the double stranded to the single stranded form of the DNA is called the melting temperature (Tm) for the DNA. In most organisms the Tm of the chromosomal DNA ranges from 85-100 degrees C. It is possible to determine the composition of the DNA experimentally from its Tm because the Tm of DNA is directly proportional to the GC content of the DNA as graphically illustrated below.
