Hydrogen bonds are not like the covalent bonds you just learned about. They do not join atoms
			into molecules. Instead, they are the attraction of an electronegative atom to a
			hydrogen that is covalently bonded to another electronegative atom. This involves the
			attraction of the hydrogen with a partial positive charge to the electronegative atom
			with a partial negative charge. Only hydrogen covalently bonded to an electronegative
			atom can participate in hydrogen bonding.
