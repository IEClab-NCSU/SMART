Life is an emergent property, and one that appears at the cellular level of organization.
					Molecules are not alive, but they are the components of life. More than 2,000
					years ago, Aristotle said “The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.”
					In biology, this is a constant theme: we can learn much about a system by
					looking at its details, but we also must step back and look at the big picture
					to truly understand the workings of life.
