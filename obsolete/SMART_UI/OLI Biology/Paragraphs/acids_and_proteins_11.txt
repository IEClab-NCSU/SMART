Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. A protein is composed of a
			series of amino acids attached end-to-end via covalent bonds. Consequently a protein
			looks like a string of beads, with each bead representing an amino acid. The bond
			between the amino acids is referred to as the peptide bond.
