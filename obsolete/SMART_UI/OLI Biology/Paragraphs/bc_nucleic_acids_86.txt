During gene expression, information stored in DNA is first copied (or transcribed) into
			RNA in a process called transcription (think about scribes copying
			books in medieval times). Only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed and the order
			of bases in RNA is determined by the base paring of the ribonucleotides with the DNA.
			Since in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead, A of the DNA will pair with
			U in the RNA. If the transcribed DNA strand has a sequence:
