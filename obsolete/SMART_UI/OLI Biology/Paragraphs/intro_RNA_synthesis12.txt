Promoters can be characterized as being strong or weak promoters depending on their affinity for RNA polymerase. The result of a strong promoter with a high affinity (tight binding) to RNA polymerase is a greater frequency of starting transcription from that promoter. Therefore, more product from transcription initiated at a strong promoter is possible compared to product formation initiated from a weak promoter in the same amount of time.
