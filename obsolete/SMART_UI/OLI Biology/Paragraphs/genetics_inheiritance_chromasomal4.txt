Aneuploidy is the condition of having too many or too few chromosomes, which results from
            errors in meiosis. If crossing-over does not occur correctly, the chromosomes can have
            extra pieces or missing pieces. If the chromosomes do not separate properly during
            anaphase, the resulting cells can have extra or missing chromosomes. This improper
            separation of chromosomes is called nondisjunction. Nondisjunction can occur in
            either meiosis I or meiosis II.
