Functional groups in this category are also referred to as
							hydrophobic (water hating) groups. They only
					contain carbon and hydrogen, and lack electronegative
						atoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Non-polar functional
					groups are often found on amino acid side chains of proteins and they also make
					up a major part of most lipid molecules. The hydrophobic nature of non-polar
					functional groups often affects the shape of molecules containing these groups.
					For example, proteins will fold into unique shapes just to prevent non-polar
					groups from being in contact with water. Some lipids bury the non-polar section
					of the molecule by the forming lipid bilayers, which shape the boundary of all
					cells
