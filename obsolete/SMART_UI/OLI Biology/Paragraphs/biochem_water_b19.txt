When a nonpolar molecule
					is
					placed
					in water, it becomes completely surrounded by water molecules. The water
					molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with the nonpolar molecules. However, they
					do form hydrogen bonds with the other water molecules that surround the nonpolar
					molecule, forming a layer of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that cover, or form
					a cage, around
					the
					nonpolar molecule. A representation of these water molecules organized around
					butane
					that
					has been added to water is shown in the following
					three-dimensional chemical structure.
