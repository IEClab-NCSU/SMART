All living organisms — from bacteria to trees to humans — are composed of molecules. To make a
					cell, many molecules must be combined, and it takes energy to build these
					complex structures. Covalent bonds hold these molecules together, and the chemical bonds
					contain energy associated with the force that holds two atoms together. As you know, some bonds are
					relatively weak and unstable. When they are replaced by stronger, more stable
					bonds, chemical potential energy is released that can be
					captured by the cell and used to do work. In cells, certain high-energy
					molecules contain many unstable bonds and are used for fuel. When these
					molecules are broken down into simpler molecules with more stable bonds,
					chemical potential energy is released. In this unit, you will learn how cells
					manage to capture this energy and use it to do work (e.g.,
					power movement or build new macromolecules).
