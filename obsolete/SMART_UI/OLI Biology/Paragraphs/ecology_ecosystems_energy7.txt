As you can see, only about 1% of incoming solar energy is stored as calories in the tissues of growing photosynthetic producers.  This energy is then passed up to higher trophic levels through a series of transfers.  On average, only about 10% of the available energy in one trophic level is incorporated and stored as calories in the bodies of the next level up.  The rest of the energy is released undigested in feces or is dissipated as heat.  The result is that all ecosystems show a pattern known as the energy pyramid in which energy availability decreases with increasing trophic level.  The bottom of the pyramid contains producers (usually plants or algae).  Each trophic level of consumers (level 2 and above) becomes progressively smaller.  The amount of energy available to consumers at the top of the pyramid is much smaller that what is available to organisms at lower levels.
