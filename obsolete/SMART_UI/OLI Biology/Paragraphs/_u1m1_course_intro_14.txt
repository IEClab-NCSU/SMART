Atoms are tiny particles that are put together to build living organisms. While
					atoms do not possess life, they are required for life. The atom is the smallest
					organizational level that we will explore in this course, and you will learn
					more about atoms in  Unit 2: Introduction to Chemistry. You will also
					learn how atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds to form molecules. In
						Unit 3: Biological Macromolecules, you will focus on the four
					classes of carbon-based macromolecules that comprise living systems:
					carbohydrates, fats, proteins and nucleic acids.
