The following animation depicts the complete process of DNA replication. In the animation
          you should be able to identify each of the stages of synthesis on each of the strands. At
          the end of the synthesis you will see that the leading strand has a continuous double
          helix generated while the lagging strand has a discontinuous set of Okazaki fragments that
          must be connected before the synthesis is complete.
