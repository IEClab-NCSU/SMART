The genetic information of an organism is stored in DNA molecules. How can one kind of
            molecule contain all the instructions for making complicated living beings like
            ourselves? What component or feature of DNA can contain this information? It has to come
            from the nitrogen bases, because, as you already know, the backbone of all DNA molecules
            is the same. But there are only four bases found in DNA : G, A, C, and T. The sequence
            of these four bases can provide all the instructions needed to build any living
            organism. It might be hard to imagine that 4 different “letters” can communicate so much
            information. But think about the English language, which can represent a huge amount of
            information using just 26 letters. Even more profound is the binary code used to write
            computer programs. This code contains only ones and zeros, and think of all the things
            your computer can do. The DNA alphabet can encode very complex instructions using just
            four letters, though the messages end up being really long. For example, the E. coli bacterium carries its genetic instructions in a DNA
            molecule that contains more than five million nucleotides. The human genome (all the DNA
            of an organism) consists of around three billion nucleotides divided up between 23 DNA
            molecules, or chromosomes.
