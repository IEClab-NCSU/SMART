In the previous sections of this module, we discussed the structure and organization of
            genes and genomes. Throughout the molecular genetics module, we have been pointing out
            the connections between genotype and phenotype. Here, we will discuss the other
            important factor in determining the phenotype of an organism: environment. The effects
            of environment on phenotype can be fairly subtle or pretty dramatic. In certain groups
            of cold-blooded animals, such as Nile crocodiles, sex is determined by an environmental
            factor: average temperature during the middle third of the incubation period. Males will
            only hatch at temperatures between 89.1° and 94.1°F. Nests with higher or
            lower temperatures will produce predominantly females.
