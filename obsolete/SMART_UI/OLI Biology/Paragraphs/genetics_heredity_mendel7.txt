When Mendel crossed purple and white flowers, the first generation of plants, which he
            designated “F1,” were all purple. Somehow, purple was “stronger,” or dominant over the
            white. So if the alleles of the purple flowers were symbolized by “B," then the allele
            corresponding to white flowers was “weaker” and is symbolized by “b.” If the genotype of
            the parent purple flower is BB, then the genotype of the parent white plant will be
            bb.
