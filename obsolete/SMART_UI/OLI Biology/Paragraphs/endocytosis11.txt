Much as the channels and pores discriminate between specific molecules and their
			transport through the membrane, specificity and discrimination are seen during
			endocytosis using specific membrane bound receptors. This targeting defines the uptake
			of specific molecules or assemblies by specific cells. The following animation
			demonstrates the process of receptor mediated endocytosis for the Low Density
			Lipoprotein (LDL) complex. The process is divided into the individual steps to emphasize
			similarities and differences among general endocytosis, protein transduction and
			receptor mediated endocytosis. Several general concepts are illustrated during the
			process including bioselectivity and intermediate recycling.
