Later weight loss comes more slowly, because body fat stores a great deal of energy and is
					associated with much less water. Importantly, body fat is not just a storage
					bin. It also has a role as an endocrine (hormone-secreting) organ. For example,
					body fat secretes a hormone called leptin. This acts on target cells in the
					brain to produce feelings of “fullness.” Loss of body fat leads to decreases in
					leptin and increasing feelings of hunger. Second, loss of weight also has
					effects on a person’s energy output. As a person loses weight, total metabolism
					goes down simply because the body is getting smaller. More significantly, the
					per-pound rate of metabolism is turned down to conserve
					energy and resist what the body perceives as “starvation.” A person in this
					state will feel sluggish and reluctant to exercise. Taken together, these and
					other mechanisms tend to automatically adjust our hunger and activity to
					maintain our weight.
