Direct interactions occur when two species make contact and affect
			each other’s well-being without the participation of any third species. Some pairs of
			species are intimately and physically connected, with a smaller species (symbiont)
			living in or on the body of a larger species (host). These direct interactions are
			described using the term symbiosis,which translates to “together living.”
			In other cases the contact between direct interactors is more fleeting, as when a bee
			visits a flower or when a hawk swoops down on its prey.
