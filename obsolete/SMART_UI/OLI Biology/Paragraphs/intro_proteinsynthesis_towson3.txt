Through experimentation it was found that the universal start code or codon is AUG and
			three stop codons (UAG, UGA and UAA) were identified. The remaining 60 codons
			represented the 20 amino acids. Having elucidated the entire code it was found that for
			many of the amino acids, the first two nucleotides in the sequence defined the amino
			acid with the third nucleotide being any of the four nucleotides. For example the codon
			for the amino acid leucine is CUX where the X represents any one of the four
			nucleotides, and the codon for the amino acid valine is GUX. This third base then became
			known as the wobble base signifying the flexibility the system has in identifying the
			third base. This also demonstrates the fact that a single amino acid can be coded by
			several triplet codes but a triplet code only represents a single amino acid. This
			triplet code for converting the sequence of mRNA to a sequence of amino acids is
			referred to as the Genetic Code.
