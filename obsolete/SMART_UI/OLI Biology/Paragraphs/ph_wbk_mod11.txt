K is the equilibrium constant (in this case also a dissociation constant) and is the ratio of charged species to the neutral species. Looking at both the chemical equilibrium given above and the equation for the equilibrium constant (K), the concentration of the acid and conjugate base will be influenced by the concentration of protons (the pH of the environment in which the reaction is placed). Using some simple mathematical substitutions, the equilibrium constant equation becomes the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation that describes the relationship between the amount of dissociation and the pH of the solution:
