In the F2 generation, Mendel observed the original phenotypes (yellow/round,
                    green/wrinkled) and two additional phenotypes: green/round and yellow/wrinkled.
                    The four alleles had combined with each other, independently of each other. This
                    outcome demonstrates the law of independent assortment.
