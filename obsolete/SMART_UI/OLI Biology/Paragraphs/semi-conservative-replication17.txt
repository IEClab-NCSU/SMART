Once the appropriate structural requirements for the synthesis of DNA are met, DNA
          synthesis occurs continuously in a unidirection process from 5’ to 3’ along the template.
          The following animation demonstrates the building of a complementary strand using the
          components required by DNA polymerase. This process can take place wherever the initial
          conditions for operation of DNA polymerase exist.
