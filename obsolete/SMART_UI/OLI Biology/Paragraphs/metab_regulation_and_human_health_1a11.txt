Why donâ€™t the normal regulatory mechanisms work to limit weight in people who
					become obese? This is a question that has fueled considerable research and
					debate. Findings suggest that there are many contributing factors. For example,
					many (but not all) obese individuals have very high circulating levels of leptin
					in keeping with their high body fat reserves. Yet the target cells in their
					brains do not respond to leptin in the normal way; they do not perceive
					satisfaction or fullness.
