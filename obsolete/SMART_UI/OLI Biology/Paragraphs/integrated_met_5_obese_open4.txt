Complex carbohydrates  are converted to monosaccharides and enter glycolysis at a number of different points.  Most monosaccharides enter glycolysis above the step catalyzed by phosophofructose kinase (PFK).  Consequently, the degradation of practically all sugars is controlled by this key regulatory enzyme.
