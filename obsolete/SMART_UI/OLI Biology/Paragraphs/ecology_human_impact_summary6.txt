The future of humanity will be strongly affected by these and other environmental
                    trends. What can we predict about how our environmental impacts will develop
                    over time? Population size will continue to increase for several more decades,
                    but it is already slowing overall and populations may peak somewhere in the
                    range of 9 - 11 billion. Over the next 40 years, almost all of the growth in the
                    world’s population will happen in lower-income nations in Asia and Africa where
                    fertility rates are still relatively high and populations have lots of young
                    people. At the same time, increasing affluence in many of these nations will
                    lead to unprecedented global levels of consumption. Many lower-impact
                    technologies are emerging that may help to reduce some of humanity’s impacts on
                    the environment, but it is unclear how quickly or widely they will spread.
