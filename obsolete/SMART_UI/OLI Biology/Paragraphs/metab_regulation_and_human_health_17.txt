On the other hand, drugs often target metabolic pathways to correct diseases. For instance,
					angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that are commonly used
					to control high blood pressure. These drugs inhibit ACE; the result is reduced
					production of angiotensin, a molecule that increases blood pressure.
