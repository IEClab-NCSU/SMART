Cells must be able to move large polar and charged
					molecules across the lipid bilayer of the membrane in order to carry
			out life processes. To allow these molecules, which are not soluble in the
					lipid bilayer, to pass across the
					hydrophobic barrier, it is necessary to provide ports,
			channels, or holes through the membrane. The molecules will still move spontaneously
			down a concentration gradient from high to low concentration. These channels can either
			remain open at all times, allowing the molecules to move freely according to the
			concentration gradient, or they can be gated channels that open and close in response to
			the needs of the cell. In most cases these channels are very discriminatory and will
			only allow specific molecules to pass. The process of moving impermeable molecules
			across a membrane (down their concentration gradients) using channels or pores is
			referred to as facilitated diffusion. Because the molecules are
			moving down a concentration gradient, the process is driven by simple
					diffusion and does not require the input of additional energy from
			the cell. The following simulation depicts the facilitated diffusion of glucose across
			the membrane using the glucose permease transporter.
