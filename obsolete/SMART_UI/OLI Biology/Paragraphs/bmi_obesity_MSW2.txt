However, you must be careful when dealing with BMI. A BMI score alone is not enough for a
			diagnosis. BMI does not distinguish between bone/muscle weight and excessive body fat.
			Some people with heavy bone structure or highly developed muscle may be rated as
			overweight or obese, despite having little body fat. However, for people of average
			stature and fitness, the BMI is a reasonable indicator of body fat.
