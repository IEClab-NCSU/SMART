Prokaryotic cells were the first cells to appear on our planet. All prokaryotes alive today
			are unicellular (one-celled), and include bacteria (singular form is "bacterium") and
			archaea (singular form is "archaean"). Prokaryotes are small cells that don't have a
			nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.
