There is perhaps no better example of artificial selection than the domestic dog.
					Dogs are descended from gray wolves, but after thousands of years of humans
					directing the breeding of dogs, we have well over one hundred different breeds.
					There are dogs with good noses that can track game and search for missing
					persons. Some dogs have been bred to herd or protect domestic animals. Some dog
					breeds are known for happy personalities and soft fur that make them great
					companions while others are known for their strength and intelligence which
					makes them good guard or police dogs. Consider the image below to get a sense of
					the power of artificial selection.
