Many humans are able to maintain a stable adult body weight over a large number of years.
			Although it may seem perfectly normal, this is an amazing feat of metabolic regulation.
			As you eat, foods are broken down and metabolized. But the energy stored in the foodâ€™s
			chemical bonds cannot be destroyed. Simply put, if more calories are consumed than are
			required for growth, activity, and maintenance, the excess energy is stored within the
			body. This energy is stored when enzymes catalyze the formation of new chemical bonds to
			create specific kinds of macromolecules (i.e., glycogen, fat, and protein), which tends
			to increase overall body mass. On the other hand, if not enough food calories are
			consumed, the body will begin to break down its own tissues as a source of energy, and
			will decline in mass as a result.
