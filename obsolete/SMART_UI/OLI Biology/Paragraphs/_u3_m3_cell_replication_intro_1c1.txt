 The chromosomes in somatic cells and germ cells are present in pairs. One
			chromosome in each pair is descended from the organism's father. The other chromosome in
			the pair is descended from the organism's mother. Each member of a chromosome pair is
			called a homologue. Together, these two chromosomes make up a pair of homologous
			chromosomes. The words homologue and homologous both begin with the prefix "homo-,"
			which means "the same or similar." So the two chromosomes in each pair contain the same
			set of instructions. The following diagram shows the relationship between homologues and
			homologous chromosomes.
