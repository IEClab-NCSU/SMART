Next, Mendel crossed the purple variety with the white variety. He manipulated his plants
            so he could control which plant pollinated which. In plants, pollen is the male gamete,
            landing on the flower to fuse with the ovuleâ€”the female gamete. The resulting zygote
            will give rise to the seed, or embryo.
