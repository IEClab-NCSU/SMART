A healthy cell has many genes that produce proteins involved in the process of regulating cell
				division. Some of these genes produce proteins that encourage cell division. These proteins would be
				produced under circumstances where the cell should divide. For example, if you scrape
				your knee, the cells in that area need to be replaced. Other genes produce proteins that
				inhibit cell division. For example, healthy human cells grown on a petri dish would stop
				growing when they filled the dish. This is also an essential component of regulation.
				Cells that continue dividing when they should not can cause cancer.
