Immune cells protect the organism by recognizing foreign matter (such as bacteria). The
			bacteria are recognized by proteins (called receptors) on the surface of the immune
			cell. The immune cell (also known as a phagocytic cell) will then engulf the bacterial
			cells using the process of endocytosis. The vesicle that contains these bacterial cells
			is called a phagosome (“eating” “body”). The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes (which
			contain digestive enzymes). The digested bacterial products are then excreted through
			the process of exocytosis.
