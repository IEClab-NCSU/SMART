In the early 1990’s an intriguing observation was made that has lead to a number of new
			approaches to drug delivery and therapeutic delivery systems. It is based on an
			observation of the activity of the transactivator TAT protein associated with the human
			immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and subsequently polyarginine (arginine is a positively
			charge, naturally occurring amino acid) and other proteins containing a basic peptide
			region referred to as the protein transduction domain (PTD). The observation was the
			translocation of virtually any molecule, particle, even liposome that has the PTD
			attached. While there is still some debate as to the exact mechanism of the
			translocation, there is some agreement on the general process. The highly positively
			charged PTD, attached to its ‘cargo’, has a tight electrostatic (ionic) interaction with
			certain molecules, which are ubiquitous to all cells, in the plasma membrane. Binding to
			the surface initiates macropinocytosis (pinocytosis with a slightly larger soluble
			molecule). The presence of the PTD provides for high efficiency initiation of
			endocytosis. While not involving a specific receptor, the binding by the PTD to the cell
			surface reduces the concentration dependence for initiation of internalization.
