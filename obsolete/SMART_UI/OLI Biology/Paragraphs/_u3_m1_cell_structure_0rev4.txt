In this unit, you will learn about the cell and all the parts that
			make it functional. You will also focus on the cell membrane, which is the structure
			that surrounds the cell and separates its internal environment from the external
			environment. This separation enables the cell to maintain homeostasis and exhibit the
			emergent property of life.
