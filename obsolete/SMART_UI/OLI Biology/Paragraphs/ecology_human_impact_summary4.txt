Biodiversity is the variety of life and includes genetic diversity, species
                    richness, and the variety of ecosystems at a regional scale. Humans are inspired
                    and comforted by biodiversity. We also depend on naturally functioning
                    ecosystems directly as a source of products and services. Natural ecosystems
                    remove pollutants from air and water, physically stabilize land, harbor animals
                    that pollinate crops, provide recreational opportunities, are a source of
                    harvested goods, and hold diverse biochemicals and other “ideas” for useful
                    products. Humans have substantially degraded biodiversity through habitat
                    destruction, species introductions, overharvesting, and pollution. Currently
                    these factors are generating the most damage in lower- and middle-income nations
                    in the tropics.
