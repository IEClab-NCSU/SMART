A small organic molecule with the structure of an amino group, a
                                carboxylic acid group, and an “R” group, which are all bonded to a
                                single central carbon atom. The difference between the “R” group is
                                what distinguishes one amino acid from another. Amino acids are the
                                building blocks of proteins.
