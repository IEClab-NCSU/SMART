In this time-lapse video, a few days of development are sped up for your viewing
            pleasure. In the earliest frames you can see large cells dividing. With each division
            the individual cells get smaller. Chemical signals in each cell are passed to its
            descendants and to nearby cells. As a result, DNA is turned “on” or “off” in each cell,
            leading to different shapes and structures. Toward the middle and end of the video,
            individual cells are much too tiny to see. Specialized cell types form. Cells move from
            place to place, grow, die to create gaps, and divide to create bulges. In this way, body
            structures begin to emerge.
