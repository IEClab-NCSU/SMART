These elements represent over 95% of the mass of a cell. Carbon is a major
					component of nearly all biological molecules. Elements are characterized by
					their atomic structure. While the subatomic structure of the atom is a major
					topic of interest in chemistry, physics and biophysics, the basic structure
					described below provides sufficient information for the construction of
					molecules in the context of this course. Atomic mass, the sum of the number of
					protons and neutrons in the atomic structure, is a particularly useful measure
					of each element. By summing the atomic mass of all the atoms in a molecule, one
					can estimate the molecular mass of the molecule, which is then expressed in
					atomic mass units or Daltons. The masses of the six atoms of the elements listed
					above are given in the following Atomic Properties TABLE. The masses
					can be found in the upper right hand corner of the box for each element in the
					periodic table.
