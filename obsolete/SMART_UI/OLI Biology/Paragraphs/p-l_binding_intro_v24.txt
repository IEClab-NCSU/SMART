It is also possible that binding the ligand causes the functionality of the protein to
			change from active to inactive, or from inactive to active. For example, the estrogen
			receptor protein, shown below in yellow and purple, binds DNA only when estrogen (red)
			is bound to the protein. Estrogen is the "key" that turns the estrogen receptor "on." In
			the figure below, the estrogen receptor is depicted with its secondary structure
			highlighted. As you can see it is mostly α-helices. The estrogen receptor
			represents a quaternary structure composed of a dimer of two protein chains shown as
			yellow and purple in the figure. 17-β-estradiol (an estrogen), the red
			space-filling balls, fits in a properly sized pocket on each of the proteins in the
			dimer. Only when both pockets of the dimer are occupied by estrogen is the receptor
			activated and able to bind to DNA. As you can see the estrogen binding pocket is only a
			small part of the total protein size.
