We can only begin to try to appreciate the complex structures and functions of a human
            body in this introductory course, but in this unit we will introduce the different human
            organ systems and then proceed to study five of them in slightly greater depth. You will
            also have opportunities to learn more about these systems in the laboratory portion of
            the course.
