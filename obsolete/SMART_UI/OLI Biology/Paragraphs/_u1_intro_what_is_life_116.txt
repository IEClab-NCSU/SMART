The invention and refinement of the microscope changed all that. Today we are
					aware of a vast diversity of single-celled, microscopic life forms that interact
					with us every day. Actually, there are over ten times more bacterial cells
					inside and on our bodies than there are our own human body cells! We are aware
					that these living things interact with every large organism on Earth, cleanse
					the water we drink, and renew the air we breathe. In particular, we are aware
					that bacteria can cause disease: this was not fully demonstrated until the late
					1800s! The earliest measures to control bacterial diseases involved sanitation:
					clean surgical techniques, water treatment, and sewage treatment. Once bacterial
					infections took hold, they were often fatal.
