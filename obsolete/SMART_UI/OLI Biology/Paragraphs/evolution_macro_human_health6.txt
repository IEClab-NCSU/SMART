A second principle of macroevolution, common ancestry, is important for another reason.
            Medical research focuses on the biology of humans. But letâ€™s face it: humans make
            terrible study subjects. We live too long, take up too much space, and have too many
            inalienable rights to be of much use in the lab! Therefore biomedical researchers also
            study other species as far-flung as worms, fruit flies, mice, fish, or rhesus monkeys.
            They can tell us a great deal about our bodies, our genes, and even our diseases. Why?
            Because these species have many inherited features that are very similar to our own.
            When we learn something about a worm or a wallaby, we learn more about ourselves in the
            process. Below we summarize just a few examples of the power of this approach.
