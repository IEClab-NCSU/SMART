We know that plants require light. But “light” is a complex form of energy. Visible light
			is just a small part of a much broader spectrum including many forms of electromagnetic
			radiation. In many ways, light behaves as a wave. Different colors of light have
			different wavelengths. In a given period of time, short wavelengths deliver more energy
			to a surface than longer wavelengths. Thus blue light is higher in energy than red
			light.
