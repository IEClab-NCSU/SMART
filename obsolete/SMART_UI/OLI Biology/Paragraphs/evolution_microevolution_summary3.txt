Mutation, gene flow, and genetic drift are additional ways in which evolution can
                    occur. A mutation can add a new allele to a gene pool. Mutations can be useful,
                    detrimental, or neutral (have no impact on fitness). If the environment changes,
                    a particular mutation’s effect on fitness can also change. Gene flow occurs when
                    two gene pools get intermixed due to the migration of individuals from one
                    population to another. The ease of world travel has led to an increase in gene
                    flow among human populations in recent years. Genetic drift is a random change
                    in the frequencies of alleles in a single population’s gene pool. Genetic drift
                    has a large effect when the population is reduced to a small number (survivors
                    in the bottleneck effect, founders in the founder effect). The result is a
                    limited gene pool where some randomly selected alleles will be more or less
                    prominent than in the original gene pool.
