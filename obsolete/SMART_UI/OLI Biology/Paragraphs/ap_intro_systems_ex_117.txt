Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that attach to, and contract
                    to move the bones. Skeletal muscles often work in pairs. When one muscle is
                    contracting, the other is relaxing. For example, to bend your arm at the elbow,
                    your biceps muscle contracts, and your triceps muscle relaxes. To straighten
                    your arm, the biceps relaxes, and the triceps contracts. The diaphragm is
                    skeletal muscle that contracts and relaxes for inhalation and exhalation.
                    Hiccups are a spasm in your diaphragm muscle.
