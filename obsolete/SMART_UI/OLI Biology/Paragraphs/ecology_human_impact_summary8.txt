We hope that you have benefited from this module. Starting with a good grasp of
                    the basics, you can learn a great deal more about our effects on the
                    environment. You can contribute to sustainable solutions through actions taken
                    at the individual and family level. And you can promote more sustainable
                    practices within any group of which youâ€™re a part,
                    whether it is a extracurricular club, church, business, government agency, or
                    nonprofit organization.
