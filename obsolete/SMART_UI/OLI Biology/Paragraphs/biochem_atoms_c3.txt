Notice that the atomic mass or atomic weight on the periodic table isn’t
					generally a whole number. For example, the atomic mass of Carbon is 12.01. How
					is that possible? Atoms can’t have fractions of protons or neutrons. The reason for this
					is that not all atoms of an
					element have the same number of neutrons. For example, carbon atoms always have
					6 protons. But some carbon atoms have 6 neutrons, while others have 7 or even 8
					neutrons. A carbon atom that has 6 neutrons would have an atomic mass of 12; a
					carbon with 8 neutrons would have an atomic mass of 14. Two atoms with the same
					atomic number but different atomic mass are called isotopes. For example, most atoms of carbon have atomic mass of 12.
					There are atoms of carbon with atomic mass of 13 and 14. These are isotopes of
					the carbon atom. The atomic mass given for Carbon (12.01) is an average value,
					taking into account all of Carbon’s different isotopes.
