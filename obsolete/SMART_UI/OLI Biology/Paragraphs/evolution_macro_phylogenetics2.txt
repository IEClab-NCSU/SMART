In evolutionary biology, the same principle is extended to related lineages. Species with
            a recent common ancestor are close relatives, like brother and sister. Their lineages
            split apart not too long ago. Other species are much more distantly related, like second
            cousins. They can be traced to a common ancestor, but this ancestor lived very long ago.
            We can tell their degree of relationship by looking at homologous
                features: shared features that were inherited from the same source and reflect
            common ancestry. Two species that are closely related share many homologous features.
            Species that are distantly related share only a few.
