To keep itself in a state of equilibrium, an organism must constantly gather
                    information and react accordingly. In humans, the 
nervous


system, made up of the brain, nerves, spinal cord and sensory
                    organs, reacts to stimuli in the environment and signals other systems when
                    actions are needed to bring the body back into balance. The 
endocrine


system, which produces hormones and other regulatory substances,
                    plays a key role in maintaining balance among chemical messengers within the
                    body. Locally, most body cells can produce chemical messages that influence the
                    metabolism of other cells. And there are some organs in other body systems that produce
                    chemicals that can travel through the body to regulate metabolic processes in
                    other organs.
