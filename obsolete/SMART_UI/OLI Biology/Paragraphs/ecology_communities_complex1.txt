Ecological communities can be dizzyingly complex. A community may be home to thousands of
			species, and every single one of them may be linked to several others through a variety
			of interactions. Among all this complexity, ecologists have worked to discover the most
			meaningful and important interactions: those that determine the stability and diversity
			of the whole community.
