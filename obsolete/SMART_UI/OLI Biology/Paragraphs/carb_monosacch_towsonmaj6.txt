 You should convince yourself that it is not possible to superimpose the bottom two
			structures. They are in fact different structures. For glyceraldehyde, where A is an
			aldehyde, B is a hydrogen and X is the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group, the structure on the
			left would be referred to as D-glyceraldehyde and the structure on the right would be
			referred to as L-glyceraldehyde based on the orientation of the hydroxyl functional
			group.
