Although only skeletal muscle is part of the muscular system, there are three
                    types of muscle tissue. Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle are similar to skeletal
                    muscle, but perform specialized functions in the body. Most of these functions
                    are involuntary and do not include the skeletal system.
