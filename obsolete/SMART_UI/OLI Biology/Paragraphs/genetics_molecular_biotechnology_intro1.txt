The ability to manipulate DNA has led to dramatic changes in medicine, agriculture, and
            many other aspects of society. For example, genes from other species are transferred
            into crop plants and livestock to provide them with desired traits. And many drugs are
            produced by bacteria, yeast, or other organisms that have been engineered to express
            human genes.
