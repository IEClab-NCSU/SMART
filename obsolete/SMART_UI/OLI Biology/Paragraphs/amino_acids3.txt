The numbering of the carbon atoms in an amino acid follows the nomenclature used for carboxylic acids.   
			The first carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group is the -carbon, 
			followed by the -carbon, etc. as illustrated in the diagram to the right.  All amino acids that are found in proteins have the same backbone
			structure, the acidic carboxylic acid group,  the â€“carbon, and an amino group that is attached to the  -carbon, 
			hence the name -amino acids.  The sidechain, or R, group is attached to the -carbon and is different for each amino acid. 
			Note that the  proton is often not drawn, but its existence should be inferred from the fact that carbon forms four single bonds.
