The structure of DNA (shown on the left below) is the molecule upon which the Central Dogma
      of modern molecular biology is based. It contains the information necessary to code for the
      RNA and proteins used by a cell or virus to replicate and produce the next generation. While a
      virus does not satisfy one of the major tenets of the Cell Theory that the entity is able to
      self-replicate, it still uses information from either its own DNA (RNA) or its host DNA to
      replicate itself.
