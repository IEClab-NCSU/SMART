The plasma membrane is a very selective barrier. We have seen how some small molecule pass
			freely, but most molecules are selectively brought into the cells using transporter proteins.
			Most of these small molecules are metabolites or ions used in the general metabolism of the cell.
		The cell also needs to transduce information across its membrane. Cells receive signals from the
			surrounding fluids and other cells. These signals may tell the cell to divide or prevent division
			and promote growth.
