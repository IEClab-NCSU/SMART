Phosphorus does not have a gaseous form, so it is not cycled globally through the atmosphere.
					Instead it circulates among living organisms, soil, water, and rocks. You can
					think of the phosphorus cycle as a combination of two cycles: one fast and
					local, the other very slow and global. The fast cycle is driven by producers,
					consumers, and decomposers. Plants and algae take up phosphate dissolved in
					water and use it to make organic compounds. Consumers feed on them and excrete
					phosphorus in their feces and urine. Bacteria and fungi decompose dead organic
					matter and return phosphates to the soil and water, completing the loop.
					Producers are extremely efficient in taking up phosphate from water and
					phosphorus is often a key resource that limits the growth of plants. Phosphorus
