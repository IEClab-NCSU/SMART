Examine the following figure, which illustrates the change in energy found within a chemical
					system as a phosphate ion is slowly brought closer to an ADP molecule. As the
					negatively charged phosphate gets closer to the negatively charged ADP molecule,
					more energy is required to overcome the particles' natural tendency to repel
					each other.
