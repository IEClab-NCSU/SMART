Fats are stored in cells as triglycerides, the condensation product of three fatty acids with the three carbon polyalcohol glycerol.  Hormonal stimulation by glucagon or epinephrine activates lipases which release the fatty acids from the glycerol.  The fatty acids are activated for oxidation in the cytosol by the addition of an coenzyme A group to the carboxylic acid, forming acyl-CoA.   After activation, the activated fatty acid is transported to the mitochondria where it is subject to a pathway called beta-oxidation.  This process releases acetyl-CoA molecules from the fatty acid, generating NADH and FADH2.  The acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle for further oxidation.
