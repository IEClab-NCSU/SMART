In this unit, we will begin by studying the atom and the subatomic particles that form
			the atom. We will proceed by examining the way atoms combine to form molecules through
			chemical bonds. We will then examine the chemistry of water as it relates to bonding. We
			will take a closer look at water, because the cellular environment is essentially
			aqueous (water) based. Finally, we discuss a concept called pH, and its implications for
			life and temperature control.
