Facilitated diffusion and active
						transport both require transport proteins
					that act as channels or ports in the membrane. Transport proteins are classified
					both by structure and by function. The structure (shape) of each channel helps
					determine what materials can pass through. Even within classes of transport
					proteins that carry out similar functions (e.g. ion channels) there are many
					different structures that can discriminate between specific substances. Dozens
					of different transporters swirl around within the fluid membranes that enclose
					your cells and organelles, contributing greatly to their "mosaic" quality.
