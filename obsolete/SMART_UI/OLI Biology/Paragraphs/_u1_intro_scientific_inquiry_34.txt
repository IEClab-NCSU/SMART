However, the control group cannot get “nothing.” Instead, the control group often receives a
			placebo. A placebo is a procedure that has no expected therapeutic effect —
			such as giving a person a sugar pill or a shot containing only plain saline solution
			with no drug. Scientific studies have shown that the “placebo effect” can alter
			experimental results because when individuals are told that they are or are not being
			treated, this knowledge can alter their actions or their emotions, which can then alter
			the results of the experiment.
