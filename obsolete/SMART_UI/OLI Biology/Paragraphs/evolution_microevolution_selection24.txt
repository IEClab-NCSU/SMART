So why do these dangerous traits exist? First, survival is only a means to an
					end: individuals that fail to mate have zero fitness, even if they are very good
					survivors. The gene pool will contain traits of those who have survived, yes,
					but also of those who have mated successfully. Second, many sexually selected
					traits (e.g. elaborate plumage, bright colors, large antlers) are known to be
					indicative of a healthier mate. Males who can “carry off” a good display and a
					successful battle are also fit in other ways. Females who are choosy are doubly
					successful in their own reproduction: they produce “sexy sons” who will
					themselves be successful in mating, and they also produce offspring that are
					generally healthy.
