Monosaccharides are the simplest sugars. The root “mono” means "one," and “saccharide” refers to an organic molecule where the
						ratio of carbon:hydrogen:oxygen is 1:2:1 (i.e.,
							CNH2NON). The more
					common monosaccharides contain six carbons and have a molecular formula of
						C6H12O6. Glucose, fructose (fruit sugar),
					and galactose are examples of six-carbon monosaccharides. A common five-carbon
					monosaccharide is ribose (the sugar component of RNA), which has a
					molecular formula of C5H10O5. DNA
					contains a modified ribose where one of the oxygen atoms has been removed, hence
					the name deoxyribonucleic acid. Shorter monosaccharides exist as
					linear molecules while five- and six-carbon monosaccharides form ring-like
					structures.
