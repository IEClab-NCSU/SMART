How can a simple molecule made of repeating nucleotides contain all instructions for
			complicated living beings like ourselves? What component or feature of DNA can contain
			this information? It has to come from the bases! The backbone of all DNA molecules is
			the same. But there are only 4 bases found in DNA : G,A,C,T! The sequence of these 4
			bases can provide all the instructions needed to build any living organism! It might be
			hard to imagine that 4 different “letters” can communicate so much information. But
			think about the English language, which can represent a huge amount of information using
			just 26 letters. Even more profound is the binary code used to write computer programs.
			This code contains only ones and zeros...and think of all the things your computer can
			do! The DNA alphabet can encode very complex instructions using just 4 letters, though
			the messages end up being really long. For example, the E. coli
			bacterium carries its genetic instructions in a DNA molecule that is more than 5
			million nucleotides long. The human genome (all the DNA of an organism) is around 3
			billion nucleotides divided up between 23 DNA molecules. The 23 different DNA molecules
			are known as chromosomes.
