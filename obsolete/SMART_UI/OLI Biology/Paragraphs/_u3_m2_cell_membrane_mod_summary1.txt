Membranes are the defining characteristic of a cell in the same way that your
					skin distinguishes what is "you" from what is "not you." Like your skin, the
					membrane interacts with the environment and controls what gets in and what gets
					out. However, additional features (such as eyes and a mouth) are necessary for
					more complex interactions with the environment. Similarly, proteins in the
					membrane further help the membrane control what enters and exits and regulate
					environmental interactions. Weâ€™ll explore transport of things in and out of the
					cell in more detail in the next module.
