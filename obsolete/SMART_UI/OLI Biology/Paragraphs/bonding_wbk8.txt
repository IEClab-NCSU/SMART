 Covalent bonds involving electronegative atoms often result in polar molecules.
					As discussed earlier, the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water
					are polar, due to the fact that oxygen is electron withdrawing and hydrogen is
					willing to give up its lone electron. The double bond between carbon and oxygen
					atoms in a carbonyl group is polar, for the same reason that the oxygen attracts
					the electrons to itself.
