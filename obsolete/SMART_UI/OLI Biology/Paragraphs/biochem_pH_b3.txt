The process of neutralization also gives off heat, indicating that chemical potential energy
			is being released during the course of the reaction. Neutralization has many useful
			applications. One such application in the laboratory is to neutralize strong acids or
			bases so that they can safely be disposed of. As you will learn later in this course,
			the addition of acids and bases to the environment leads to ecosystem damage, so before
			a strong acid or base can be disposed of, it must be neutralized (to make water and
			salt) to prevent injuries or environmental damage. In your everyday life you may be
			familiar with acid and base neutralization through your lawn care and gardening
			activities. Grass grows best in a very mildly acidic soil (pH 6.5 to 7). So if your soil
			is too acidic (less than pH 6.5), you would need to add a compound like limestone (a
			basic mineral) to your soil to neutralize the excess acidity and correct the pH level.
			Likewise, if your soil is too basic (pH above 7), you would need to add sulfur, which
			interacts with water in the soil to form sulfuric acid, to help neutralize the excess
			base in the soil.
