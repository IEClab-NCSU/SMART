Both nutrients and
                    wastes are made of atoms; they occupy space and have mass. The atoms retain their identity
                    through the processes of life, even though they can be combined with other atoms
                    in different ways. Consider the picture above. When a wolf is eaten by a bear,
                    the atoms that made up the wolf become part of the bear. The matter in the wolf
                    that is not absorbed or used for growth by the bear becomes waste. The bear
                    excretes this waste in urine, in feces, and in its exhaled breath. Atom for
                    atom, all the matter that was the wolf can be accounted for, and it is recycled
                    through the ecosystem. The waste produced by one organism can provide nutrients
                    to another.
