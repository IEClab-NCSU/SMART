Once the synthetic gene has been successfully spliced into the expression plasmid, the
            complete expression plasmid must be taken into the bacterial cell. This is a delicate
            process that must take place under special conditions. In these conditions, the
            expression plasmid is mixed with bacterial cells, allowing some of the cells to take up
            one circular DNA molecule. The origin of replication on the expression plasmid will
            cause the bacteria to replicate the plasmid along with its own chromosomal DNA. It is
            not possible to determine which cells have taken up the expression plasmid.
            Consequently, the cells are grown in the presence of an antibiotic and only those cells
            who have obtained the expression plasmid will live because of the gene for antibiotic
            resistance that is also present on the expression plasmid.
