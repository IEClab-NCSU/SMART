Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions within a living organism. A
					chemical reaction is a chemical change in which new molecules are formed from
					existing molecules. Reactions that release energy are called
						exergonic (“exer” refers to “out” and “gonic” refers to
					“energy,” so these are “energy out” reactions). Reactions that require energy
					are called endergonic (“energy in”). Exergonic reactions can be
					used to power endergonic reactions. For example, building ATP from ADP and a phosphate molecule
					requires energy (it is an endergonic reaction).
