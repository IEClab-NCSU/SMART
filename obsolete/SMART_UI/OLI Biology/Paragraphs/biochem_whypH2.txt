One way in which changes in pH are moderated is through the use of buffers.
					Buffers are aqueous solutions that can resist changes in pH. When an acid or a
					base is added to a solution containing a buffer, the pH of the solution will
					only exhibit a very minor change. Blood is a buffered solution. The liquid
					portion of blood contains carbonic acid (H2CO3). It
					dissociates (breaks apart) to produce bicarbonate ions
						(HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+). This
					reaction is easily reversible. If acid enters the blood (H+
					concentration goes up), most of the excess hydrogen ions will bond with
					bicarbonate, restoring carbonic acid. If a base enters the blood, the H+
					concentration will initially go down. But then carbonic acid will
					dissociate to replace the “missing” hydrogen ions. Thus the easily reversible
					reaction works to oppose any pH change in the blood. A buffered solution cannot
					absorb an unlimited amount of acid or base. As acid or base is added, any
					buffered solution will eventually reach a limit called the “buffering capacity.”
					At this point, no additional hydrogen ions can be absorbed or produced, and the
					buffer stops working. The solution’s pH will change rapidly if further acid or
					base is added.
