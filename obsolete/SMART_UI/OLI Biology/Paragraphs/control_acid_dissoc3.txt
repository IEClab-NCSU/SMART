 For the following acid dissociation: HA 

 A- + H+ with an equilibrium
					constant of: 



K
a

=


[

A


]
[

H

]


[
HA
]




 How will the equilibrium position change when the proton
					concentration changes? If protons are added [A-] must decrease and
					[HA] increase in order for Ka to remain the same. Likewise if protons
					are removed by adding a strong base then [A-] must increase, and [HA]
					decrease to keep Ka constant. The ratio of [A-] to [HA]
					changes depending on the total [H+] of the solution.
