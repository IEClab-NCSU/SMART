Starch, another branching polysaccharide, is the primary
					form in which excess glucose is stored in plants (and other producers). Starch,
					just like glycogen, is composed of individual glucose monomers joined together.
					And, like glycogen, starch is broken down to release individual glucose
					molecules that can be used to build ATP. The difference between these two energy
					storage polysaccharides lies in the organization of the glucose
					monosaccharides.
