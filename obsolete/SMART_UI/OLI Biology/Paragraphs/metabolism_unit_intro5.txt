Many microorganisms, such as yeast, can utilize the energy stored in glucose in
					the absence of oxygen (anerobic growth), the most common form of this process is
					fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, yeast still
					produce ATP by the partial oxidation of glucose, releasing smaller amounts of
					CO2. The remaining carbon atoms in glucose are converted to
					ethanol. The energy stored in ethanol can be used as a fuel for our internal
					combustion engines. Humans also undergo anaerobic metabolism during vigorous
					exercise, however lactic acid is produced instead of ethanol. When sufficient
					oxygen becomes available, the carbon atoms in lactate are converted to
					CO2. Other organisms that perform fermentation produce a variety
					of other end products. 
Alternative Pathways such as
					fermentation are addressed in a separate module.
