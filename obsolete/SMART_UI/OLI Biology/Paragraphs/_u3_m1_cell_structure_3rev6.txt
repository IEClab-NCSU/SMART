The nucleus is surrounded by a double-layered membrane called the
									nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is
							studded with pores that allow information from inside the nucleus to
							enter the cytoplasm. You can imagine that a
							factory command center would not be very effective if it did not have
							doors or windows through which to pass information to the rest of the
							factory.
