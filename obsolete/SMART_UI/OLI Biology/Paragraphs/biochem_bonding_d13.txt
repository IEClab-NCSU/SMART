Hydrogen bonding has a significant effect on the properties of molecules. For example,
			the structure of the DNA molecule is in part held together by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen
			bonds also create coils and other structures within the complex protein molecules that
			are essential to lifeâ€™s diversity. Finally, water behaves the way it does because of the
			hydrogen bonds that attract water molecules to each other.
