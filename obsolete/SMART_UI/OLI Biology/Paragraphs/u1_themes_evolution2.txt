evolution is about how and why life changes over time. It happens
            at levels greater than the individual: a single bird cannot evolve, but a
                population of
                    birds can
                         evolve. It also occurs over generations of time, not within a
                        single lifetime. A formal definition might be that evolution is a theory of how and
                        why life changes in populations or higher-level groups over generations of time.
                        Evolution is really just a long-term study of inheritance, shifting the focus from
                        families to populations or even species.
