The peripheral nervous system can be subdivided into two subdivisions:
                            the somatic and autonomic divisions. The somatic nervous system includes
                            sensory neurons that send sensory information from sensory receptors of
                            the skeletal muscle, skin and special senses (including smell, taste,
                            sight, hearing and equilibrium) to the central nervous system and motor
                            neurons that control skeletal muscle.
