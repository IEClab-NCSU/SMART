Cellular respiration and fermentation both break down
						organic molecules to build ATP. However, cellular
					respiration is aerobic while fermentation is
					anaerobic. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than anaerobic
					respiration. Cellular respiration produces as much as 15 times more ATP than
					fermentation. The table below shows the ATP yield from one glucose molecule for both processes.
