Cells continually encounter changes in their external ionic environment and will
			spontaneously respond by attempting to equalize the concentration of ions on the inside
			and outside of the cell. Because the plasma membrane (lipid bilayer) is significantly
			less permeable to ions than water, the establishment of an equal concentration of the
			ions on either side of the membrane is accomplished by the net movement of water toward
			the higher concentration of ions to reduce the concentration. This movement of water in
			response to an imbalance of solute (ion) is referred to as osmosis. This is illustrated
			in the following simulation.
