When water freezes, the water molecules become arranged into a regular crystal. Each water
					molecule is bound by four hydrogen bonds to its neighbors. In this arrangement,
					the water molecules are further apart than they are in liquid water. Thus, the
					density of ice is less than the density of liquid water. Ice, the solid state of
					water, can float in the liquid state. This is important for lakes and ponds that
					contain fish and plants. When the temperature goes below freezing, ice is
					formed. The ice is less dense than the liquid, so it floats on the top of the
					lake or pond. The surface ice insulates the pond, helping it to retain heat, and
					keeps the pond from freezing solid.
