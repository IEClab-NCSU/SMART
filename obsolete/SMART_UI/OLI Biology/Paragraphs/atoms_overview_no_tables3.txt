Elements are characterized by their atomic structure. While the subatomic
					structure of the atom is a major topic of interest in chemistry, physics and
					biophysics, the basic structure described below provides sufficient information
					for the construction of molecules in the context of this course. Atoms are made
					up of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and
					neutrons are at the center of the atom and have a mass of 1 atomic mass unit
					(a.m.u) each. Each proton has a positive charge (+1), while neutrons are neutral
					(they carry no charge). Each electron has a negative charge (-1) and zero mass.
					Two atoms that differ by the number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same
					element (e.g. radioactive isotope of iodine is used for cancer treatment).
