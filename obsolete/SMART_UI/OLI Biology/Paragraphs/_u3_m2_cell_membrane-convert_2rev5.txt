 In simple diffusion, both large and small molecules spontaneously move
					from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration following random
					movements, referred to as Brownian motion. The classic example is the diffusion
					of a drop of ink placed in a beaker of water. The concentrated drop of color
					slowly disperses (diffuses) until at some point equilibrium is reached and the
					water in the beaker appears to have a uniform color. The following animation
					depicts this simple diffusion process. Add ink to the beaker and watch the
					diffusion process. After a period of time, how has the distribution of the ink
					changed in the beaker? Follow the yellow ink for some time. Does its behavior
					change as time passes?
