 The diagram below illustrates this process of photosynthesis, fermentation, and
					aerobic respiration. During aerobic respiration, the carbon atoms in glucose
					combine with oxygen to produce CO2; the glucose is
						oxidized, releasing energy. The energy from the oxidation of
					glucose is stored in a small chemical called ATP for immediate use by the
					cell. ATP is used for almost all of the energy needs of the cell, from the
					synthesis of other complex molecules to doing mechanical work, such as running.
					You will learn more about these two pathways in the section about “Anabolic and Catabolic Reactions.”
