Industrial Age. The Industrial Age began in Europe in the
            1700s and continues today. Agriculture continued to improve and cities continued
            to grow. Global trade moved people and ideas around the world. Science helped to
            spark new technologies. Machines harnessed external sources of energy to
            accomplish all kinds of work. Fossil fuels became the main source of energy for
            transportation, farm work, heating, cooling, manufacturing, mining, and other
            activities. Scientific principles were applied to improve public health,
            beginning with vast improvements to sanitation in cities. Sewage treatment, safe
            municipal water supplies, public garbage disposal, and soap are all Industrial
            Age innovations. Modern medical practices, including aseptic surgery,
            antibiotics, and vaccinations, were developed. At the same time, the reliability
            and quality of food supplies continued to improve.
