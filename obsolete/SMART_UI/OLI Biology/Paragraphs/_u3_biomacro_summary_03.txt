Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic
				acids each have distinct properties that emerge due to their chemical
			structure and formation of large assemblies. You should be able to relate the structure
			of macromolecules to their function. Two important small organic
				molecules that you should be familiar with are the carbohydrate
				glucose and the nucleic acid ATP. Can you describe the role of ATP
			and glucose in biology?
