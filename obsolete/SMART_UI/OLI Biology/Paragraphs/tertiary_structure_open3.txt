 Proteins contain a mix of 
					hydrophobic and 
					hydrophilic amino acids.  
					
					
					
					Hydrophobic molecules contain no or very few highly electronegative atoms and do not 
					form strong bonds with water. In aqueous solutions hydrophobic molecules are driven 
					together to the exclusion of water. This is an example of the hydrophobic effect previously 
					described in the section on bonding. 
					
					
					As a protein folds to its final three-dimensional structure, the hydrophobic parts of the 
					protein are forced together and away from the aqueous environment of the cell.
