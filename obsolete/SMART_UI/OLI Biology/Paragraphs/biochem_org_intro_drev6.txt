Polar functional groups contain electronegative atoms like nitrogen (N), oxygen
					(O), and sulfur (S). The presence of electronegative atoms in a functional group
					results in an unequal distribution of charges on the atoms, causing the bonds to
					become polar. Because polar bonds interact favorably with water, compounds with
					polar functional groups also interact favorably with water, making them
					hydrophilic, or water-loving. Some compounds contain both non-polar and polar
					functional groups; molecules of this type are referred to as amphipathic
					molecules. In addition to interacting favorably with water, the polar atoms can
					also participate in chemical reactions and polar functional groups are usually
					responsible for the catalytic properties of enzymes.
