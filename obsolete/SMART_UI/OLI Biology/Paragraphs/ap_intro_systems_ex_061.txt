The cardiovascular system transports, from one part of the body to another:
                    nutrients, oxygen, ions, proteins, hormones and other signaling molecules, as
                    well as waste products, including carbon dioxide. This system also helps to
                    maintain homeostasis of fluid volume, pH, and temperature.
