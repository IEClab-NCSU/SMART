The Challenge: DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA at rates up to 500 bp/sec. There
          are basically three types of mistakes that the enzyme can make during the synthesis:
          substitution of an incorrect base, insertion of an extra base or failure to insert a base
          resulting in a deletion. The consequences of these errors will be apparent as we move
          toward the discussion of DNA transcription and RNA Translation. In the context of
          Replication it is important to touch on at least a couple of the means by which the system
          corrects errors or reduces the frequency of errors.
