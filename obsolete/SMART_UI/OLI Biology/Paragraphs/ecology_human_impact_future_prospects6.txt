After high standards of living have been achieved, societies have tended to shift
                    toward use of lower-impact and greener technologies. Take, for example, the use
                    of fossil fuels. Within the United States and Europe several trends such as
                    greater efficiency and a shift toward renewable and nuclear power have led to
                    reduced emissions of carbon dioxide per dollar of goods and services
                    generated.
