In the Mendelian pattern, it is possible to pinpoint a gene/allele coding for a
                    specific protein to a particular trait. There are, however, more complex
                    patterns to consider as well, such as epistasis, in which genes can influence
                    each otherâ€™s expression, and polygenic inheritance, in which more than one gene
                    is responsible for a particular trait.
