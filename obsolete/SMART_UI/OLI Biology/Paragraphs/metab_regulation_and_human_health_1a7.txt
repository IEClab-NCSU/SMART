How are caloric intake and energy output balanced? Your levels of hunger and
					overall metabolic rate change in response to your nutritional status. When your
					stomach is empty, a hormone called ghrelin is secreted. This acts on receptors
					in the brain to stimulate feelings of hunger. When the stomach is full, ghrelin
					secretion stops and so do your cravings for food.
