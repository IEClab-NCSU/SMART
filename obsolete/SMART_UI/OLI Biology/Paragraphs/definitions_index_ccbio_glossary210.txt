Metabolism is the sum of all chemical activity within a living
                                organism; it is the sum of all of the metabolic pathways within an
                                organism. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical
                                conversions, each of which is catalyzed (generally speeded up, but
                                sometimes slowed down) by an enzyme (protein catalyst).
