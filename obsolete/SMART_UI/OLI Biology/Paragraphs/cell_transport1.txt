The cell membrane creates a physical barrier between the interior and exterior of the
			cell. Only some small molecules and ions can cross the membrane freely. For all other
			molecules there are specific proteins that allow molecules to cross the membrane. These
			proteins are very specific to the type of molecule they transport, just as enzymes are
			very specific for their ligands.
