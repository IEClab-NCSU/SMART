Enzyme phosphorylation. The addition of phosphate groups to serine, threonine,
        and tyrosine residues on enzymes can cause a change in the shape of the active site of the
        enzyme. This change in shape is an allosteric effect. The change may lead to a more active
        enzyme (allosteric activator) or a less active enzyme (an allosteric inhibitor).
Enzyme levels. Recall that the rate of product formation is proportional to the
        amount of enzyme. Enzyme levels can be increased by the conversion of inactive forms of the
        enzyme to active forms. This form of regulation occurs with digestive enzymes. These are
        made in an inactive form in the pancreas, but activated by cleavage in the small intestine.
        The levels of enzyme can also be varied by regulating the synthesis of the enzyme. This
        method of regulation is common during development, when certain enzymes are only present
        during defined developmental stages.
