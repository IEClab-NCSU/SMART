Regardless of where DNA is stored in the cell, it contains instructions for building
			proteins. For protein synthesis to occur, genetic information stored in DNA must first
			be copied into RNA. In eukaryotic cells, RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, where
			protein synthesis takes place. Thus, while both RNA and DNA can contain instructions for
			making proteins, DNA is used for storage of this information, while RNA is directly
			involved in making proteins.
