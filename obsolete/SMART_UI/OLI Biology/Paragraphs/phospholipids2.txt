The cell is composed of two distinctive environments: the hydrophilic aqueous
					cytoplasm and the hydrophobic lipid membranes. The lipid environment is defined
					by the family of molecules that are characterized by their hydrophobic nature
					and their common metabolic origin. Three members of the lipid family of
					molecules will be discussed in this course: fats (triacylglcerol),
					phospholipids, and steroids.
