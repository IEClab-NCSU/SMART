A key feature of biology, as well as all other sciences, is that our understanding of
			biology has developed through the application of the scientific method. In science,
			doubt is a celebrated value and evidence takes the form of verifiable observations.
			Based on existing knowledge and observations, scientists form one or more hypotheses on
			how a system works. Hypotheses are tested by analyzing data from experiments or
			observations to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the data. A
			non-scientific claim is a hypothesis that cannot be effectively
			tested by verifiable observations or experiments.
