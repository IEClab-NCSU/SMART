As previously discussed, greenhouse gases absorb and reemit heat. There is a
                    clear theoretical basis for the idea that increases in greenhouse gas levels
                    should warm the climate. There is also an abundance of direct evidence that
                    climate has warmed in association with higher concentrations of greenhouse gases
                    over time. Coinciding with the observed increase in greenhouse gases, scientists
                    have documented substantial increases in the average temperatures of Earthâ€™s air
                    and oceans, particularly since about 1950.
