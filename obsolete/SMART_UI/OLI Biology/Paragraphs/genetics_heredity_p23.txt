For example, protein enzymes in plants catalyze production of the pigments, resulting in
            flowers of different colors. The color of the flower is one of the observable traits, or
            the phenotype of the plant. The genetic information that produces these traits
            is called the genotype of an organism. Depending on the pigment production,
            the flowers can have a variety of different colors. Flower color is determined by specific
            genes in the cells. The variations in the same gene are called alleles. In
            our example, different alleles of the pigment-producing gene can result in more or less
            pigment, and, consequently, in darker or light flower color.
