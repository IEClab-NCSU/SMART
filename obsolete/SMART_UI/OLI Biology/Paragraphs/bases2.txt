All of the bases have the common structural characteristic that they are planar
            structures due to the aromatic (alternating double bonds in the rings) structure of
          the molecules. This feature parallels that previously seen with the phenyl group [Refer to
          the Functional Groups simulation in the Glossary to review the structure of the phenyl
          group]. This aromatic character also gives rise to the ability of the bases to absorb
          ultraviolet light at 260 nm. This latter feature provides a distinctive means for
          identifying the presence of DNA and RNA molecules.
