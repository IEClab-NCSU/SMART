An example of creativity in science is Barbara McClintock and her research on color patterns in corn 
                        kernels. In the early 20th century, scientists assumed genetic material was static and unchanging as
                        it was passed from one generation to another. McClintock noticed that the color of corn kernels did not
                        follow typical dominant-recessive inheritance patterns, which ran counter to the idea of stable
                        genes, which was widely accepted at the time. Barbara McClintock used imagination to postulate the mechanism
                        by which genes would move positions on chromosomes and effect the expression of neighboring genes. When 
                        observing corn chromosomes under a microscope, she noticed that DNA fragments regularly broke off, or disassociated,
                        from a chromosome and reinserted itself into another chromosome. She called these segments of DNA “jumping genes”
                        or transposable genetic elements (transposons). Later, she gathered evidence to show that when transposons changed 
                        positions on chromosomes, the color of corn kernels changed.
