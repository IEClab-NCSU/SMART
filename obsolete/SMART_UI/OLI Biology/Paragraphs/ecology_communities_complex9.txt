Kelp forests provide a glimpse into the many facets of community ecology. They are
			complex, with more than twenty species of kelp plus hundreds of animal species. They
			also are structured in an understandable way, with some species interactions more
			important than others. As ecologists continue to unravel community interactions, we are
			improving in our ability to predict how communities will respond to factors like
			hunting. Kelp forests are a treasured resource for recreational diving and fishing. Kelp
			also are harvested for use in aquaculture and industry. The science of ecology can help
			us learn more about kelp forests and supports our efforts to safeguard these dazzling
			communities.
