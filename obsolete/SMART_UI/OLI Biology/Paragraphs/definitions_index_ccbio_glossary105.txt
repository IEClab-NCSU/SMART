Synthesis of a new DNA double helix. It is the process by which a
                                cell, when dividing, makes a copy of its DNA by an enzyme-catalyzed
                                reaction. Each strand in the existing double helix is used as a
                                template strand to build a new DNA strand. The result of DNA
                                replication is that the daughter cells produced in cell division
                                have the same DNA as the original cell.
