There are two basic parts of the cell membrane. First there is the plasma
					membrane that surrounds the cell and creates a barrier that separates the cell
					contents from the outside environment. The plasma membrane is selective allowing
					only specific molecules to cross. It selectively imports ions to control the
					water balance of the cell. The cell membrane also provides a mechanism for
					moving large molecules into and out of the cell.
