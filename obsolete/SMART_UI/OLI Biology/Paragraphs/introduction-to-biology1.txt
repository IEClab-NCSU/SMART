Welcome to OLIâ€™s Introduction to Biological Principles!  We are happy you have joined us in our exploration of the 
			fundamental principles of biology.  But before we begin, it is first necessary to consider what Biology actually is.  
			In its most basic definition, biology is the scientific study of life.  That is to say biology is the branch of 
			science that studies life, living organisms, and the way organisms interact with their environment.  As shown on 
			the figure below, science can be broken down into two main branches - natural sciences and social and behavioral 
			sciences.  Biology is a branch of natural sciences the encompasses all of the related sub-branches (e.g. ecology, 
			biochemistry, and microbiology) that all study different aspects of living organisms.  The other branch of natural 
			sciences is the physical sciences like chemistry and physics.  It is important to remember that even though science 
			is broken down into branches and sub-branches of study all of science is interconnected.  For instance, to 
			understand how a cell responds to a certain environmental signal, it is necessary to understand something of the 
			chemical composition of that signal, so chemistry is important for biology.  Likewise, understanding how the brain 
			functions (neuroscience) can aide in the understanding of certain behaviors, so  biology is important for the social 
			and behavioral sciences.
