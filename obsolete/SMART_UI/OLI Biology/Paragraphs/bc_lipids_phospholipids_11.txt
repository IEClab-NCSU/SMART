Phospholipids are an important class of lipids found in the membranes of all cells and
			organelles. A phospholipid contains only two fatty acids attached to a glycerol, which
			in turn is bound to a phosphate group. Together, the phosphate and the glycerol make up
			the “head” of the phospholipid. The fatty acids make up the molecule’s “tail.” The
			phosphate group carries a negative charge and is therefore hydrophilic. The tail, on the other
			hand, is made up of nonpolar fatty acids and, like other lipids, is hydrophobic.
			Thus phospholipids, like fatty acids, are amphipathic. An amphipathic molecule has both
			a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end.
