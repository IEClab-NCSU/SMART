Germ cells are diploid cells that go through the process of meiosis to
					form haploid gametes. This process can happen at different times, depending on
					the organism. For example, in humans, the male gametes (sperm cells) are formed
					continuously from germ cells in the testes, starting in puberty. Female gametes
					(eggs or oocytes), on the other hand, are formed in the ovaries during fetal
					life. They remain in the ovaries, “stuck” in the final stages of meiosis, which
					is not completed unless fertilization occurs.
