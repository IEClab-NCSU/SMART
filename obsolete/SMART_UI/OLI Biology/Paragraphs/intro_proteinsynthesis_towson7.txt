Transfer-RNA (tRNA) was introduced in the section on the structure of DNA and
			RNA and its production and post-transcriptional modification were briefly described in
			the previous section. As seen in the illustration below, tRNA is produced as a primary
			transcript in a linear primary structure. Following processing the tRNA folds into the
			cloverleaf secondary structure. In this structure it is easy to see the 3’ end of the
			structure with its ACC sequence that is common to all tRNAs. In addition the bottom loop
			in the structure (the anticodon loop) contains the sequence that is complementary and
			antiparallel to a sequence on the mRNA. This secondary structure folds to a tertiary
			structure in the form of an inverted L. The 3’ end is at one end of the structure and is
			the site that will carry a specific amino acid that corresponds to the sequence of
			nucleotides in the anticodon at the other end of the molecule. The process by which the
			correct amino acid is added to the correct tRNA is referred to as the charging of the
			tRNA. The formation of the charged tRNA is a two-step process as depicted in the
			"Charging" animation below.
