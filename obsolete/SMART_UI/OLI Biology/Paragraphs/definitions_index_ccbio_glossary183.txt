The stage of the cell cycle when division (mitosis) does not occur.
                                During interphase, the cell grows, acquires nutrients, and
                                replicates both its chromosomes as well as its organelles.
                                Interphase consists of the G1 (chromosomes condense),
                                    S (DNA duplicates), and G2 (DNA integritiy
                                checked and repaired) phases of the cell cycle. Cells spend the
                                majority of their time in interphase.
