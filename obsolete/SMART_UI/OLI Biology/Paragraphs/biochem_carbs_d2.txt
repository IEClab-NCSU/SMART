For a quick boost of energy, simple sugars are the carbohydrate of choice; diabetics will
			oftentimes carry a sugary food or drink with them in case their blood sugar level drops
			too low. However, excessively high blood sugar levels can be equally dangerous.
			Accordingly, doctors routinely suggest that diabetics eat a diet high in fiber to help
			manage their diabetes, since fiber helps to slow the absorption of sugar into the
			bloodstream, which helps diabetics to prevent spikes in blood sugar. In contrast with
			simple sugars, complex carbohydrates are broken down by the body more slowly and energy
			is released in a stepwise fashion.
