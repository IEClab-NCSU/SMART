If we compare traits of individuals within species, we find that they share certain
            traits, but they also show many differences among individuals. Rice in the figure above
            shows variation in shape and color of seeds/grains. People also come in different shapes
            and sizes. What determines physical traits that characterize a person: hair color, eye
            color, height, weight? How about behavior: some people are risk-takers, others get
            easily anxious; some people love to be in large noisy crowds, others prefer quiet and
            solitude. What is more important in determining physical and behavioral traits: genetics
            or environment? This classic “nature vs. nurture” argument should not be phrased as
            “either/or,” because the answer is “both.” The interactions between genes and
                environment determine the traits. A better question to ask is “To what extent
            is each trait determined by genetics and to what extent by environment?” The answer will
            vary by trait and is still being researched (it is not a trivial question to answer, and
            these numbers are only rough estimate):
