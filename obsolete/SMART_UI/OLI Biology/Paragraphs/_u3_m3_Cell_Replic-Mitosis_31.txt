Mitosis begins when DNA condenses into chromosomes visible under the light microscope.
			This packaging of the chromosomes into condensed bundles makes them easier to sort, but
			it inhibits protein synthesis. Therefore, it is essential that the cell has produced all
			necessary proteins prior to the start of this process.
