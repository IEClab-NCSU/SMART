Catabolic reactions (also called “catabolism”) break down
					larger, more complex molecules into smaller molecules and release energy in the
					process. The smaller end products of a catabolic reaction may be released as
					waste or they may be fed into other reactions. The energy that is released by
					catabolic reactions can be captured and used in many ways. Some of the energy is
					released as heat and increases the temperature of the cell. Sometimes the energy
					is stored in the chemical bonds of another molecule. And sometimes it can be
					used to do work, such as movement of cellular machinery to power the active
					transport of materials across cell membranes. Catabolic pathways
					generally are degradative, releasing energy and electrons from oxidative
					processes;
