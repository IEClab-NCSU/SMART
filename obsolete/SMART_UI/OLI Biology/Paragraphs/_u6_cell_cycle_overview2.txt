The cell cycle is the "life cycle" of a cell. It is the set of stages that a
			cell goes through during its lifetime. Cells go through five major stages of
				development: G1, synthesis (S), G2, mitosis (M), and cytokinesis. The events that occur
			during stages G1, S, and G2 are nearly the same in all types of cells. Together, these
			three stages of the cell cycle are called interphase. The events that
			occur during mitosis (M) and cytokinesis stages are different, depending upon the type of cell.
			The diagram below shows an overview of the stages in a cell's life cycle:
