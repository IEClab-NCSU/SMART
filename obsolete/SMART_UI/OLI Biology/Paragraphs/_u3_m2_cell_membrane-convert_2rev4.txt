Molecular substances enter and exit the cell so that: nutrients and waste can be exchanged;
					the cell can perform its function; and, when required, the cell can send
					appropriate signals to other cells. Transporting some substances may require the
					cell to exert energy and other molecules may cross through
					the membrane passively, requiring no use of energy by the cell. One way
					molecules passively move through the cell membrane is a process called simple
					diffusion.
