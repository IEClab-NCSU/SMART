The tendancy of an atom to hold shared electrons more close to its
                                nucleus. Atoms like oxygen have a high electronegativity. This means
                                when oxygen forms a covalent bond with an atom of lower
                                electronegativity, the shared electrons will stay closer to the
                                oxygen atom than to the other atom. Strongly electronegative atoms
                                bonded to weakly electronegative hydrogen atoms, in a molecule,
                                result in hydrogen bonding. The most important strongly
                                electronegative elements in biological systems are oxygen and
                                nitrogen.
