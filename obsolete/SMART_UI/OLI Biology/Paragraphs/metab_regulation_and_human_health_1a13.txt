Our society’s main effort to overcome obesity has come in the form of dieting. Diet fads
					constantly come and go — Atkins, South Beach, Acai Berry, the Hollywood diet,
					and pills, drinks, or even machines that purportedly melt away fat. In fact, the
					total sales of weight loss services and products were estimated at over $55
					billion in 2009. Unfortunately, all of this effort and expense does not appear
					to do much good. Surveys, clinical trials, and literature reviews have
					repeatedly turned up a depressing pattern: about 80 percent of dieters regain
					lost weight within one to five years — and very often shoot past their prediet
					weight with each cycle.
