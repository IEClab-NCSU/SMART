Having explored the requirements for DNA polymerase, it is clear that the prokaryotic and
          eukaryotic genomes fail the first requirement of a single stranded sequence of DNA.
          Therefore to initiate DNA replication it is necessary to create the conditions that will
          allow DNA polymerase to carry out DNA synthesis.
