The amino acids in the active site of enzymes play two roles, and sometimes those roles
			overlap. Some of the amino acids in the active site are responsible for binding of the
			substrate and others are responsible for facilitating the chemical reaction. Enzymes are
			generally quite specific for their substrates. Although lactase and pepsin both catalyze
			the same type of reaction, breaking a bond using water (hydrolysis: "hydro" means
			"water" and "lysis" means "to break"), lactase only functions when lactose is its
			substrate and pepsin can only break peptide bonds.
