Lotisha is a biology student who is learning about acids and bases. One of her lab assignments
				was to determine if bleach, vinegar, and water are acidic, basic, or neutral. She
				decided to use red and blue litmus paper to test these solutions. Lotisha poured
				each solution into a separate beaker, and dipped both red and blue litmus paper into
				each beaker. Observe her results to determine whether each substance is acidic,
				basic or neutral.
