At this point, the two fragments are not firmly held together by covalent bonds; the
            sugar-phosphate backbone is still broken on both strands. DNA ligases can be used to
            rejoin DNA after it has been cut with the restriction enzyme. This reaction requires
            energy (usually ATP) and requires that the two pieces of DNA that are being
            joined are close to each other. Since the sticky ends hold the two ends close together
            it is easy for DNA ligase to join the fragments, reforming the phosphodiester bonds on
            both strands.
