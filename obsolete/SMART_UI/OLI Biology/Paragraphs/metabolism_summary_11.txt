In this unit you learned about one of the key features of life: the ability to
				transform energy and matter. Energy comes in different forms:
			light energy, potential energy in chemical bonds, heat, and mechanical energy of motion.
			Living organisms convert one form of energy into another in a stepwise matter using
				metabolic pathways. All metabolic pathways rely on enzymes (catalysts) to
			speed up chemical reactions and are carefully regulated.
