What is the connection between genes and traits? We must now consider alleles, which are observed variations in the sequence of bases for a
            particular gene. Two alleles of a gene may differ by a single base. On one end of the
            spectrum, an allele may refer to a total deletion of a gene. A diploid organism has two
            alleles of each gene, one from the organismâ€™s mother and one from its father. The
            combination of the two alleles of a particular gene is the genetic determinant of the
            phenotypic traits of the organism. Note that in addition to genetic factors, environment
            also contributes to traits. We will consider environmental effects in a later section.
