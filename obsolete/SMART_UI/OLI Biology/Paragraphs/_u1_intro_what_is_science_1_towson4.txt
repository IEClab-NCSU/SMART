Science is based on empirical evidence. The word empirical refers to both qualitative and quantitative
                    data that can be gathered through observation using the senses. In addition, technological tools such 
                    as microscopes, telescopes and computers can be used to enhance scientists’ ability to make observations.
                    An inference is a logical interpretation of a scientist’s observations.While some scientific concepts 
                    may be theoretical in that they are derived primarily from logic and reasoning, ultimately all scientific
                    ideas must conform to known observational or experimental data in order to be considered valid.
