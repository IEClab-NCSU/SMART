In order to carry out their functions, some proteins need to be embedded in the membrane.
			These proteins are called integral proteins (“integral” because they are “integrated”
			into the membrane). For example, a membrane protein that transports materials into or
			out of the cell needs to completely span the membrane. On the other hand, a protein that
			binds the cell to another can simply be attached to the outer surface of the membrane.
			Proteins that are attached to the inner or outer surface of a membrane are called
			peripheral proteins.
