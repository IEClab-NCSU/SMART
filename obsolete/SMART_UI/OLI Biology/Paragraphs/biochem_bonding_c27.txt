Structural Formulas: There are many different ways to draw
							molecules. For example, look at the glucose molecule shown on the right
							in a structural formula. Notice that the structure consists of a carbon
							backbone running down the middle of the molecule. Each carbon has formed
							a covalent bond with four other atoms. (The first carbon actually formed
							two bonds with the oxygen atom; this is called a double bond. This
							carbon still formed a total of four bonds, even though two of the bonds
							are with the oxygen atom.)
