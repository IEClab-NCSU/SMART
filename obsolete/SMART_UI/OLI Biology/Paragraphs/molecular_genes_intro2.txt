Even cells of the same type may express different genes and therefore produce different
			proteins, depending on their needs or environmental conditions. For example, pancreatic
			beta cells produce insulin when blood sugar levels are increased. Weightlifting
			increases muscle mass because it increases the production of proteins in the muscle
			cell. Sex hormones are not produced until the beginning of puberty.
