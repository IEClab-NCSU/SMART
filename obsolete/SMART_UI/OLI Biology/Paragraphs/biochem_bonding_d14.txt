The water molecule is a very important example of a molecule that can form hydrogen bonds.
					It is the hydrogen bonding of the water molecules that gives water many of its
					unique and life-sustaining properties. One water molecule consists of two
					hydrogen atoms 
						covalently bonded to a oxygen atom.
