Let’s examine the structure of a nucleic acid polymer. How are nucleotide
					building blocks connected to each other? The alternating "phosphate - sugar -
					phosphate" building blocks form a backbone of the linear polymer. Bases are
					attached to the backbone via the sugars and are equivalent to the “side chains”
					of amino acids in proteins.
