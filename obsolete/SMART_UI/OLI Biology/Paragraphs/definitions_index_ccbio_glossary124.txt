A type of cell that has a membrane-enclosed nucleus and other
                                membrane-enclosed structures (called organelles) such as
                                mitochondria, chloroplasts, cytoskeleton, and the Golgi apparatus.
                                All organisms except bacteria and archaea are composed of eukaryotic
                                cells (also referred to as eukaryotes); that is, all species of
                                animal, plants and fungi are composed of eukaryotic cells.
