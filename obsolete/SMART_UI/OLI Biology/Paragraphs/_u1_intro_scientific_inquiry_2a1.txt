When conducting scientific experiments, researchers develop hypotheses to guide
					experimental design. A hypothesis offers a testable and falsifiable explanation
					of observations. For example, a scientist might observe that maple trees lose
					their leaves in the fall. She might then propose a possible explanation for this
					observation: “cold weather causes maple trees to lose their leaves in the fall.”
					This statement is testable. The scientist could grow maple trees in a warm
					enclosed environment such as a greenhouse and see if their leaves still dropped
					in the fall. The hypothesis is also falsifiable. If the leaves still dropped in
					the warm environment, then clearly temperature was not the main factor in
					causing maple leaves to drop in autumn.
