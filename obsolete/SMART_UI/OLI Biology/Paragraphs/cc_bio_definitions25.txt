 A group of subjects in an experiment that does not receive the treatment to
                        be evaluated, but is otherwise similar to the experimental group. The
                        control group provides a strong basis for comparison, demonstrating what
                        happens in the absence of the factor being tested. For example, in a study
                        to test the effectiveness of a drug, experimenters would predict that the
                        control group subjects—those who did not receive the drug—would not be cured
                        over the course of the study.
