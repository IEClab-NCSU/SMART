Plant leaves are the main location of photosynthesis. They are often large, flat surfaces that are adapted for maximum light absorption. In land plants, the leaves are also often found on the ends of tall stems. Growing as tall as possible is an adaptation that helps the plant get to the sunlight; short plants are shaded by taller ones. The problem with growing tall, is that most of the water is found underground. Photosynthesis needs more than just light and pigments to work. One of the two additional items that are needed is water.
