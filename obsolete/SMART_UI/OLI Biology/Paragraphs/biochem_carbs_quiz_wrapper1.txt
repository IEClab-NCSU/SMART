All living organisms contain four major classes of macromolecules, one of which
                    is carbohydrates. Often referred to as "carbs," carbohydrate molecules consist
                    of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 1:2:1 ratio. Complex carbohydrates are
                    built when simple sugar molecules are covalently bonded together. The main
                    function of carbohydrates is to store energy, which the living organism can use
                    at a later time. Carbohydrates also function as structural materials and in
                    cellular signaling and recognition.
