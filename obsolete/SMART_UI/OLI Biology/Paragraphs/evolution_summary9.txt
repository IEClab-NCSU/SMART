Evolutionary biology provides a huge range of practical benefits. An understanding of
            microevolution has allowed us to develop effective therapies to combat HIV and to make
            great progress against malaria. We are most effective when we recognize that any
            infectious disease is an evolutionary dance involving adaptations among pathogens,
            vectors (like the mosquito), and hosts - including humans. On another level, “tree
            thinking” helps us navigate biodiversity with greater intelligence. And our kinship to
            other species means that we can learn a great deal about ourselves by exploring model
            organisms in depth.
