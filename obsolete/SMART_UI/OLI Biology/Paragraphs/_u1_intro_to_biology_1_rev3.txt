Now that we have a better understanding of what biology is, it is next important
					to ask why we are interested in studying it. Why does it matter if we learn
					biology? We (humans) are living organisms, and understanding the principles of
					biology helps us to better understand ourselves and the world around us. Have
					you ever taken an antibiotic to help you get rid of an infection? That was the
					result of a lot of biological science research! Biologists first studied
					infections and found that they are caused by microorganisms (very small life
					forms). Other scientists studied how these microorganisms live and have
					developed medications that will kill the microorganisms but not harm you. Do you
					know someone who has cancer? Cell biologists are helping to find cures and
					treatments for cancer; since the 1970s there have been huge improvements in
					survival rates for many common cancers. Biology helps to keep us well and is the
					foundation for modern medicine.
