In the previous module, you learned how genetic information is stored in DNA and how it
			is passed in its totality to the next generation through the process of DNA replication.
			You also read about PCR, a practical application of the DNA synthesis process. In this
			module, we will focus on how this information is expressed. Information contained in DNA
			is organized into genes, and each gene contains instructions for
			making a functional product: an RNA molecule or a protein. This process of making the
			functional gene product is gene expression. Different cells can
			contain the same DNA, but they express different genes and produce different proteins
			according to their function. For example, red blood cells produce the protein
			hemoglobin, which is required for delivery of oxygen throughout the body. Nerve cells
			contain the same DNA, but the hemoglobin gene is not expressed. Instead, nerve cells
			make RNA copies of the genes that encode proteins required for signaling.
