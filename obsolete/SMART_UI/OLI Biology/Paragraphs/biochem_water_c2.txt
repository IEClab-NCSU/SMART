When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the
			water droplet, even though the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs
			because of the surface tension that is created by the water molecules. Cohesion and
			surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating on the top. Many
			insects are specially adapted to exploit surface tension, which allows them to literally
			“walk on water.”
