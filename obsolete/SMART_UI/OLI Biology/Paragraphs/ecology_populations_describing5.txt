As illustrated by the case of Valley Forgeâ€™s deer population, population size and density
			are dynamic, or changeable, numbers. As humans we care about changes in the density and
			sizes of other populations. We notice when the density of mosquitoes skyrockets after a
			summer rain. We are concerned about the population sizes and densities of animals we
			hunt, fish we harvest for food, and endangered species we seek to conserve. Much of
			population ecology is directed toward predicting, understanding, and controlling changes
			that occur in the populations of other species over time.
