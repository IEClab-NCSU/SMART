The shape of the chromosomes changes throughout the cell cycle. For example, when a cell
            needs to divide, DNA is further compacted by the addition of scaffolding proteins that
            help divide copies of the chromosomes equally. The most compact shape of the chromosomes
            can be observed during cell division.
