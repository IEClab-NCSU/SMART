Note that a person who inherits “tall”  genes may never grow very tall because of illness
            or inadequate nutrition. Conversely, a person who inherits a faulty growth hormone gene
            may grow relatively tall if he or she is treated with growth hormone. These are examples
            of how environment and genes interact to produce traits and phenotypes.
