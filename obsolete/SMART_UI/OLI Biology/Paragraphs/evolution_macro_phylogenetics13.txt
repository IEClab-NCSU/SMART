Why do scientists think that the chemical similarities of cells reflect shared ancestry?
            As with vertebrate limb structure, the genetic similarities among life forms are more
            than a passing resemblance. DNA sequences are detailed, complex, and contain a great
            deal of information. In a court of law, DNA evidence can be used to tie a suspect to a
            crime scene sample: it is extremely unlikely that two long DNA sequences would show an
            exact match unless they came from the same source. In evolutionary biology, the same
            sort of reasoning applies: long chunks of DNA sequences match closely among species and
            are evidence for shared ancestry. Thus we can now analyze inherited characteristics that
            have been present for not just millions but billions of years.
            In these ancient gene sequences we see the deepest roots of the tree of life.
