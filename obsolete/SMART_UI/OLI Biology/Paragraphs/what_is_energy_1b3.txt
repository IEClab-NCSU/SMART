Where does chemical energy in food come from? The sun provides solar energy, the energy
					source for most living things. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms can use
					solar energy to build sugar molecules from simpler raw materials (carbon dioxide
					and water). A sugar molecule stores chemical energy in the bonds that join its
					atoms. The energy stored in sugar can be released and used to build other types
					of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, etc.), which also contain stored
					chemical energy in their complex structures.
