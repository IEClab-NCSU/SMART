We have now explored two corners of the “Interactions in Malaria” triangle - the mosquito
			vector and the malaria parasite. As you can see from the question above, there are
			several ways in which malarial parasites can evolve resistance to anti-malarial
			medications. This is a real world problem in the fight against malaria. Resistance to
			almost every drug available to prevent or treat malaria has been reported, and the rates
			of resistance are only increasing. Insecticide resistant mosquitoes are also
			contributing to the problem because many areas where malaria is rampant rely heavily on
			pesticide control of the mosquito populations to curtail the spread of malaria. If the
			mosquitoes are no longer killed by the pesticide, then there will be more mosquitoes
			around to transmit malaria.
