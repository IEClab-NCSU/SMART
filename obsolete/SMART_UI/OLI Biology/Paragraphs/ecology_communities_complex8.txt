Sea otters are uniquely suited to eating the urchins. With their dexterous paws and long
			incisors, they can crack open the urchins, eating the soft flesh inside. Sometimes they
			even use rocks as tools to crush tough prey. After eating an urchin, a sea otter
			discards its empty shell, or test. A study published in 2011 by
			Estes and Jane Watson reported that when broken tests sink to the bottom, remaining
			urchins will flee from the immediate area. Thus, sea otters can reduce urchin numbers
			and change urchin behavior. In this way, otters safeguard kelp and help to maintain
			healthy kelp forests.
