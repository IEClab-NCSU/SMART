Lactase is an example of an enzyme that breaks large molecules down into smaller
                    ones. Lactase is produced in the intestinal tract of mammals and breaks the
                    sugar in milk, lactose, into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. The
                    monosaccharides can then be metabolized to produce energy.
