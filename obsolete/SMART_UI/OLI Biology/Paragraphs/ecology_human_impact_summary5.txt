Physical and chemical factors have also changed as a result of human influence.
                    Examples are diverse and widespread, involving many different aspects of the
                    atmosphere, land, and water. One particularly important human impact is now
                    known as anthropogenic global climate change. This trend is also known as global
                    warming and is related to a natural phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.
                    Certain gases warm the climate by absorbing and re-emitting heat radiation,
                    keeping temperatures warmer and more stable near the planetâ€™s surface. Humans
                    have strengthened this effect by adding extra greenhouse gases to the
                    atmosphere. Some results have included increased temperatures, increased sea
                    level, increasingly variable weather, melting ice and permafrost, increasing
                    droughts, shifts in species distributions, and shifts in the timing of seasonal
                    events.
