A and B are codominant, which means that if the individual has both A
                    and B alleles, he will be of AB blood group, which expresses both proteins. On
                    the other hand, O is recessive, so only the homozygous recessive individuals
                    will have an O phenotype (blood group O). When representing the three different
                    alleles for blood type we represent the codominant alleles by A and B for the A
                    protein and B protein respectively. The recessive O allele is represented by
                    lower case ‘i.’
