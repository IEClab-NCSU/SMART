The scientists will test this hypothesis by separating 2392 young women into 2
						groups: the control group and the experimental group. The control group(s)
						receives no special treatment, or the treatment that is currently most common. The
						results from this group give the scientist a base-line reading of what normally
						occurs. The experimental group(s) is the group that will receive the new
						treatment. The results of this group will be compared to the results of the control
						group so that a judgment can be made.
