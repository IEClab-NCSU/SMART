The energy pyramid also has implications for humans.  Our diet is very flexible.  Strict vegetarians live on trophic level 2.  Those who eat a lot of animal products live closer to trophic level 3.  When grain is fed to animals much of its calorie content is used by the animals themselves, and only a small fraction is available to us in the food that is produced.  Therefore people who eat a diet rich in animal products generally have a greater total environmental impact—in terms of crops consumed, fertilizers used, land area farmed, etc.—than those who eat plant foods.  And as seen in the largely vegetarian traditional diets of rural China or India, a given land area can support more people at lower cost if they live on trophic level 2.
