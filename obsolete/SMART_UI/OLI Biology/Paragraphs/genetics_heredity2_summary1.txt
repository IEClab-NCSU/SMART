The relationship between alleles is not always as simple as dominant/recessive.
                    Sometimes the resulting phenotype is an intermediate of the dominant and the
                    recessive phenotypes (as in incomplete dominance). Other times, two dominant
                    alleles are expressed concurrently (as in codominance).
