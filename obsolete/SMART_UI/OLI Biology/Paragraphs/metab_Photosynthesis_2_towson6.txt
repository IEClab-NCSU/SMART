In the experiment mentioned above, George Engelmann used bacteria to measure the
				amount of photosynthesis achieved by algae. The bacteria he used in his study
				require oxygen to live. In each zone along the length of the filament, there were
				different wavelengths of light. So, some algal cells were photosynthesizing mainly
				with red light, others with green light, etc. The amount of photosynthesis supported
				by each wavelength was measured by how many bacteria were able to live in each zone.
