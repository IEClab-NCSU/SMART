Cellular respiration is catabolic because it takes glucose (a
					complex molecule with 6 carbons) and reduces it to carbon dioxide (each with
					only one carbon) and water (oxygen joined to two hydrogens). Some of the energy
					released by this process is captured in ATP, which can be stored for later
					use.
