At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins embrace
			substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to an enzymeâ€™s active
			site. As a result, activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more
			quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt.
			Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their
			function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in.
