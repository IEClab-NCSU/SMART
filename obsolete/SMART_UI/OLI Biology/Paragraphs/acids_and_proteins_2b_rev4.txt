Proteins spontaneously fold to form their functional three-dimensional shape, reaching the
					lowest energy state, because this is the most stable state. The folding process
					can be reversible, meaning that a folded protein can unfold and then refold.
					However, unfolding can also be irreversible, where the unfolded protein chains
					tangle with each other, forming an aggregate and precipitating out of solution.
					This is often referred to as a denatured state. Conditions that
					cause proteins to unfold and denature are extremes of temperature and pH.
					Cooking denatures proteins by heating so they unfold and denature. The same
					effect occurs when proteins are exposed to the low pH in your stomach. This
					helps your body digest the proteins found in your food, and it helps kill
					ingested bacteria and viruses.
