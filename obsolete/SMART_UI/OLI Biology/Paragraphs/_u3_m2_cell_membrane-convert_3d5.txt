People with cystic fibrosis have unusually salty sweat. Sweat glands are tubes
				embedded in the skin that are lined with special cells that reabsorb sodium and
				chloride ions from the sweat as it moves toward the surface of the skin. The channel
				responsible for reabsorbing chloride ions is CFTR.
