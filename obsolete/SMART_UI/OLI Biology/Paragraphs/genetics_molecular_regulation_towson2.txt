In bacteria, groups of proteins that are expressed together to execute the same
            biochemical pathways, are often encoded together in a region of DNA called an operon.
            Operons allow the cell to control gene expression based upon environmental conditions,
            such as nutrient availability. In addition to the structural genes (the genes that
            encode the proteins necessary to execute the specific pathway), operons contain
            regulatory genes and sequences. Below are the regulatory genes and sequences found in an
            operon:
