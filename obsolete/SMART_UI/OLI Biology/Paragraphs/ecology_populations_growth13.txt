Compared to linear growth, the exponential growth pattern is a better starting point for
			predicting how populations will change over time. It captures a little bit of reality,
			in that a bigger group will have more individuals capable of producing offspring.
			However, it is important to emphasize that the table and graph above are based on a
			“what-if” exercise. They show numbers generated by a model of
			how populations increase. This model assumes that the growth rate will remain constant
			and predicts how the population will change if this condition is met.
