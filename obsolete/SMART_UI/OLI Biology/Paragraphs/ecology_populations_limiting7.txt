At least in principle, we can predict what will happen to a self-limiting population over
			time: it should grow until it reaches its carrying capacity and then remain stable. This
			pattern of change is calledlogistic growth. It is simple to
			describe logistic growth with a math equation that allows a population to grow when it
			is small but causes it to level off when it reaches a predetermined value (the carrying
			capacity). A logistic model for the Valley Forge NHP is shown below, superimposed on the
			actual population data from the park.
