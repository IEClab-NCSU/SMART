Since the protein kinases and phosphatases that are involved in the activation of enzymes are
      enzymes themselves, amplification of the initial hormone-receptor signal occurs. This is
      especially true in the case of the hormones glucagon and epinephrine where additional
      amplification occurs due to the production of a large number of cAMP molecules per signalling
      event.
