 In the case of sucrose, the composition is a molecule of glucose and a molecule of
			fructose. The structure is described as glucose-alpha,beta
1,2-fructose. In this structure it is instructive to identify the anomeric carbon on the
glucose and the fructose molecules since they are both involved in the formation of the
glycosidic bond.
