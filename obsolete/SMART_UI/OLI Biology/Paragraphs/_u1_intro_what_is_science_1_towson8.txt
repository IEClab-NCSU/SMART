Another characteristic of science are the elements of objectivity and subjectivity that form the foundation 
                    of all scientistsâ€™ work. Scientists are skeptical and apply mechanisms such as peer review and crosschecking of new results with
                    existing data to improve the accuracy of scientific knowledge.  Skepticism and peer review are two ways in which scientists strive 
                    for objectivity in their work. Nonetheless, personal values and beliefs, intuition, academic training, experiences and expectations 
                    of scientists play a significant role in the development of scientific knowledge. Thus, there is inherently a degree of subjectivity 
                    reflected in all scientific observations, inferences and interpretations.
