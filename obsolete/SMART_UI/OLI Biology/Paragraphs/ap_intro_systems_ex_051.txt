Our body constantly transports molecules from one place to another to carry out the
            required metabolic functions for daily living. As we take in nutrients and oxygen, these
            molecules must be delivered to the cells, tissues, and organs that need them for
            metabolic processes. Furthermore, our body must have a system for disposing of wastes
            generated by metabolism and foreign particles, which may potentially disturb optimal
            body function. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems coordinate a diverse set of
            transport functions.
