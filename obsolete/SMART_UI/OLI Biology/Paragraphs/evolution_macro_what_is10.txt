Two additional members of the Spoonbill clade, genus Platalea.
            Royal Spoonbill (left), Eurasian Spoonbill (right). All spoonbill species have a similar
            bill shape and mode of feeding, but species vary in distribution, behavior, genetics,
            coloration, structure, and plumage. Left image by Fir0002(Wikipedia) (Royal
