 The capacity to do work. Work is any change that wonâ€™t happen on its
                                own. Work can involve movement, building larger molecules,
                                increasing the concentration of chemicals, increasing the
                                temperature of an object, making a sound, or even glowing
                                (bioluminescence). All living things need energy to run the
                                processes required for life.
