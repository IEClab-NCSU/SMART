When the amount of the charged species is equal to the neutral species then the log[CH3COO-/CH3COOH] is equal to 0 and thus the pH = pKa. The ultimate net charge on the functional group (the carboxyl group in this case) is dependent upon whether the pH is above below or equal to the pKa. When half of the molecules are charged (the pH equals the pKa) the net charge of molecule is 0.5 (in this case –0.5 since a carboxyl can either be zero charge or –1). When the pH is much lower than the pKa (one pH unit below) the net charge is actually –0.1. For practical estimation purposes, we will use the general rule that if the pH is one pH unit below the pKa then the functional group will be fully protonated and thus in this case the net charge will be rounded to 0. At one pH unit above the molecule the functional group, in this case the carboxyl group, would have an actual net charge of –0.9 because the proton will be lost from the carboxyl group. Again for estimation purposes, we will round all values one pH above the pKa of a carboxyl to –1.
