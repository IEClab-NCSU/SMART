Organisms of different species affect each other through many different kinds of
                    interspecific interactions. Some species live in close physical contact
                    (symbiosis). Interactions can be classified based on their effects on each
                    party. The three principal types of interactions are mutualism (win-win),
                    competition (lose-lose), and predation (win-lose). Key examples of mutualism
                    include pollination, seed dispersal, and many symbiotic interactions involving
                    microbes that live in or on larger plant and animal hosts. Competition is common
                    among species with very similar requirements, and is particularly prevalent
                    among plants. All organisms are involved in predation, playing roles as
                    predators and/or prey. Symbionts that harm their hosts are classified as
                    parasites.
