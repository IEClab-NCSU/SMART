At the end of the development process, two new cells are produced. These cells
			represent the next generation of cells in this lineage (just as your parents represent
			one generation and you represent the next generation). Each of the new cells is called a
			daughter cell. Do not be confused by the use of the word daughterâ€”it does not mean that
			these are female cells. Regardless of whether they are male or female cells, the newly
			produced cells are called daughter cells.
