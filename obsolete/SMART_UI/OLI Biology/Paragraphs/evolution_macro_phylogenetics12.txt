In 1990 Woese published a paper proposing a change in the classification system. He
            reported that there were consistent differences in ribosomal gene sequences among three
            major groups. Above the level of Kingdom, he proposed three Domains of life. Two of them
            are made up of prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea). The third is called Eukarya and
            includes all organisms whose cells have nuclei, including fungi, animals, plants, and
            several groups of protists. Woeseâ€™s data have since been greatly expanded, and the new
            data are consistent with the idea that the three Domains are the first three branches on
            a unified tree of life.
