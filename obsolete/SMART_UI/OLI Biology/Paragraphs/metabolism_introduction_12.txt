Energy and carbon flow through the biosphere in a tightly coupled manner. The coupling
			between energy and carbon is accomplished within an organism through the process known
			as metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of all of the metabolic pathways within an
			organism. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical conversions, each of which are
			catalyzed by an enzyme (protein catalyst). The compounds that are internal to the
			pathway are referred to as intermediates in the pathway. A number
			of pathways, such as those related to energy production, are essential to life and found
			in all cells. Although specialized cells may possess different pathways, there are
			common characteristics that apply to most pathways. These will be covered in the module “ 
				
Common characteristics of metabolic pathways
.” In the modules dedicated to 
Energy
 and "
ATP: The Universal Energy Carrier in Cells
" you will learn, in more detail, how energy is transformed and
			transferred during metabolic reactions.
