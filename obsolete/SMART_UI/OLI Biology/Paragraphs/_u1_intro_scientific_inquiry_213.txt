Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also bias the
						results of the experiment. Subconscious non-verbal cues can alter the patient’s
						experience and therefore the results of the experiment. Therefore, many clinical
						studies are “double blind” where neither the doctor nor the patient knows which
						group the patient is in until all experimental results have been collected.
