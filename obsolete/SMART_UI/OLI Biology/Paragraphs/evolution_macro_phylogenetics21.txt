Using modern computers and a variety of analytical techniques, biologists can now compare
            vast amounts of genetic data among hundreds or even thousands of species. They can
            sometimes even include DNA sequence data extracted from fossils! The result has been a
            huge improvement in our ability to identify the clades within the tree of life.
