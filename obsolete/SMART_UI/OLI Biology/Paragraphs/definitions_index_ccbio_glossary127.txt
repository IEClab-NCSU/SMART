 A group of subjects in an experiment that receives the treatment to
                                be evaluated. If the hypothesis is correct, the dependent variable
                                will change in a predictable way within the experimental group. For
                                example, in a study to test the effectiveness of a drug, a high
                                proportion of those in the experimental group would be cured or
                                helped by the treatment, if the hypothesis is correct.
