All living organisms--from bacteria to trees to humans--are composed of molecules. To
			make an organism, many molecules must be combined, and it takes energy to put molecules
			together. Covalent bonds contain energy associated with the force that holds the two
			atoms together. Some bonds are relatively weak and unstable. When they are replaced by
			stronger, more stable bonds, chemical potential energy is released. In cells, certain
			high-energy molecules contain many unstable bonds and are used for fuel. When these
			molecules are broken down to simpler molecules with more stable bonds, chemical
			potential energy is released. Cells can capture this energy and use it to do work (e.g.,
			power movement or build new macromolecules ). How cells manage to
			do this is discussed in the Metabolism unit of the course.
