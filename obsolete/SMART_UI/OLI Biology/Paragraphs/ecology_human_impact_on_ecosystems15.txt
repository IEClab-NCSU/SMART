Many ongoing natural processes also influence levels of greenhouse gases, but
                    these processes have not changed in a way that can account for the extra
                        CO2 in the air. Typically natural processes cancel each other
                    out; they are part of cycle that is more or less in balance. Human activities,
                    by contrast, have a history of rapid increase that tracks very closely with the
                    observed increase in the airâ€™s greenhouse gas levels over the past century.
