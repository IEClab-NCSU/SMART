 Molecules are made up of atoms covalently bound to each other. For example, a
					molecule of methane is a carbon atom covalently bonded to four hydrogen atoms;
					and water is composed of an oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms.
					Molecules can also be complex containing many atoms covalently bonded to each
					other, for example, cholesterol. Note that cholesterol also contains bonds that
					involve the sharing of more than one valence electron between two atoms creating
					a double bond indicated by C=C. In this case, each carbon still only
					participates in making four bonds. This will be discussed later in the section
					on bonding.
