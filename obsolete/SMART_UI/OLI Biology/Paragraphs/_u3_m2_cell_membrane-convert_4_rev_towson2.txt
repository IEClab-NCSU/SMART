In endocytosis, material is engulfed within an infolding of the plasma membrane
			and then brought into the cell within a cytoplasmic vesicle. To begin endocytosis, a
			particle encounters the cell surface and produces a dimple or pit in the membrane. The
			pit deepens, invaginates further, and finally pinches off to form a vesicle in the
			cytoplasm of the cell. Note that during the process the inside surface of the newly
			formed vesicle is the same as the exterior surface of the cell. Thus the integrity of
			the cytoplasm and the orientation of the plasma membrane are preserved. Once
			internalized, a new vesicle containing solid materials may fuse with a lysosome so that
			its solid contents are digested. The resulting molecules may be released to the
			cytoplasm for use within the cell.
