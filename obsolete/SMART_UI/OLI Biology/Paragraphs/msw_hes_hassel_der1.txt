        		First we start with the general equation for K:
        		
        			 K=[A-][H+][HA]
        		
        		Next take the log of both sides. This is similar to calculating the pKa.


        			 log(K)=log([A-][H+][HA])

        		Using the rules of logs we can separate the right side of the equation into two terms.

        			 log(K)=log([A-][HA])+log([H-])
        		
        		Next we multiply everything by -1. Remember these numbers are usually much smaller than one and log of these terms would be negative. By multiplying by -1 we make the numbers positive.

        			 log(K)=log([A-][HA])log([H-])
        		
        		Now two terms should be familiar: pKa = -log(K) and pH = -log([H+]). So we substitute those in.

        			 pKa=log([A-][HA])+pH
        		
        		Finally we re-arrange to arrive at the familiar form of the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation.

        			 pH=pKalog([A-][HA])
