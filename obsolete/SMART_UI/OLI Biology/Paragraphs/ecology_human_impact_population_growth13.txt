We humans are incredibly ingenious as individuals. But as part of an organized
            culture that has accumulated knowledge since the Stone Age, our power is far
            greater. Consider a gadget like a laptop computer. No one human really knows how
            to make a laptop, and certainly no individual could manufacture one from scratch
            working alone. Instead, thousands of individuals must contribute specialized
            knowledge to make the parts and assemble them in a working unit. Making a laptop
            also depends on extraction of metals and oil from deposits around the world, and
            requires heavy inputs of fossil energy. Similar feats of cooperation and
            innovation allow us to make airplanes, smart phones, heart monitors, reliable
            automobiles, and thousands of other useful objects. Unfortunately, we also have
            the power to do great damage to the environment and its ability to sustain life.
            We simplify and reshape ecosystems. We overuse resources so that they become
            scarce and costly. We make atomic weapons and synthesize chemicals that are both
            persistent and toxic. We overload natural geochemical cycles, leading to the
            accumulation of wastes. These and other impacts will be described further in
            this module.
