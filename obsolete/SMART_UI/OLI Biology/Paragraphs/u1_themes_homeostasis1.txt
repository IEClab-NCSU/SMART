Living organisms detect and respond to changes in the conditions of their external
            environment. In response to threats and opportunities, organisms may move or change
            their activities. For example, plant stems can grow toward a source of light. Over time,
            the trunks of trees strengthen when they are flexed by the wind. Animals, of course,
            respond to stimuli with a huge range of behaviors from the hibernation of bears to your
            own development of “goosebumps” on a chilly day.
