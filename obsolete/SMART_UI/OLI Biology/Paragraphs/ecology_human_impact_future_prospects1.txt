We began this module by considering how three factors have changed over time: human
            population size, affluence or material consumption, and human use of high-impact
            technologies. Next we examined how these factors have led, through various mechanisms,
            to effects on biodiversity and climate. But what does all this say about the future?
            Here we will conclude by looking at how population, affluence, and technology may
            change, and how these changes are likely to affect humanityâ€™s impact on the global
            environment.
