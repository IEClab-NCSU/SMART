Energy is recognized by what it DOES: it makes “work”
					happen. It makes things change. Energy exists in many forms. Some biologically
					important forms of energy are light energy, electrical
					energy, sound energy, and thermal or heat energy. Kinetic energy is
					the energy of motion. Potential energy is stored energy. Energy can
					change forms and often transforms from potential to kinetic energy, and back. In
					biology, a key form of potential energy is chemical energy: the
					energy stored in chemical bonds. It can be released when certain bonds are
					broken. Chemical energy is released when wood is burned: the bonds in the wood
					are broken, releasing light and heat energy.
