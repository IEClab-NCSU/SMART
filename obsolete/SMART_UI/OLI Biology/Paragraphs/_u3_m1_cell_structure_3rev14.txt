The cytoskeleton is formed by a series of protein
					filaments, and is both a scaffold for the cell structure and a framework for
					many cellular activities, including movement and cell division. In our factory
					analogy, the cytoskeleton is represented by structural beams, as well as any
					transport infrastructure, like hallways, elevator tracks, or even small
					railroads. In the cell, the cytoskeleton is made up of many different protein
					filaments. One important filament is actin, which has a
					prominent role in cell movement, maintaining cell shape, and connection to other
					cells, as well as intracellular transport. A barrel-shaped structure only
					present in animal cells is the centriole, which plays a
					role in the spatial organization of the cell and cell division. Centrioles are
					formed by microtubules, another filament type of the
					cytoskeleton. Microtubules also form appendages such as the
							flagellum of the sperm cell and the
							cilia of the cells of the respiratory system.
