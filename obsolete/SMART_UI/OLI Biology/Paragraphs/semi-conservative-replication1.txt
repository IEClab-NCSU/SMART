DNA replication is the process by which DNA is copied resulting in a faithful replicate
          of the original double stranded DNA. Key to the inheritance of the code for materials
          produced and used in a cell, DNA replication must be faithful thus not allowing or
          minimizing errors during the process and it must generate new DNA that can be transmitted
          to the next generation. Because DNA replication generates a copy of the original, it is
          referred to as DNA dependent DNA synthesis. It is dependent on DNA because it
          must have a template to use in making the copy and the result is a new strand of double
          stranded (duplex) DNA.
