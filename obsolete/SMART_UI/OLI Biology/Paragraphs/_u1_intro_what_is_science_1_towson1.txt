Science is both a body of factual knowledge and a process for understanding how the natural
                    world works. When we use the term “natural” in this context, we mean all that can be observed
                    with our senses or with instruments that extend our senses. Although there are many fields or
                    disciplines within science, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry and physics, there are common
                    activities in which scientists in all fields engage in order to explore and test natural phenomena.
                    These activities include observation, measurement, comparison, predicting and hypothesizing, creating
                    ideas and conceptual tools, and constructing explanations.
