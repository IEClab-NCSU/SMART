An image of a living mouse cell in culture is shown above. As the cell adheres to the
			bottom of the culture dish it spreads out exploring the local environment giving it
			the angular shape. The cell can move, utilize energy, and divide to produce new cells.
			During this course you will explore the fundamentals of how a cell is able to carry out
			each of these processes. Modern biology is about the molecular events that occur inside
			a cell: the making of proteins, the building of cellular structures, and the interaction
			of a cell with its environment.
