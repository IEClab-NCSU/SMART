The development of cancer requires mutations in BOTH proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor
					genes. A malfunctioning proto-oncogene is called an oncogene because it promotes the
				development of cancer. The root “proto-” refers to "before" and the root “onco-” refers
				to "cancer." A defective tumor suppressor gene can no longer suppress tumors. Cancer is
				the result of numerous mutations in multiple genes involved in regulating the cell
				cycle.
