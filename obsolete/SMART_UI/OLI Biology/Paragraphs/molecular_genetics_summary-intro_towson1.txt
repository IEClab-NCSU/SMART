In this unit, you learned about genetic information from the molecular point of view. In
            the DNA Function module , you learned that genetic information is stored in the sequence
            of bases in the DNA molecules. The theme “structure determines function” clearly applies
            to DNA: the double-stranded structure of DNA provides a way for copying the information
            each time a cell has to divide because each of the two strands serves as a template for
            the new double-stranded DNA molecule (DNA replication). In the Gene Expression module,
            you learned how information stored in DNA is used by the cell to make proteins. Central
            dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to
            protein. The two key processes involved in gene expression, transcription and
            translation, involve distinct enzymes and in eukaryotic cells are physically separated
            by the nuclear membranes. In this module you also considered how changes in DNA
            (mutations, genotype) can affect amino acid sequence of the proteins and their function
            (phenotype).
