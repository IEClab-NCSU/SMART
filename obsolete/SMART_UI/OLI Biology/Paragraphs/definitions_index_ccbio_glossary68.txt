A combination of DNA and proteins that constitutes chromosomes. The
                                term chromatin is used to refer to the extended form taken by the
                                chromosomes when a eukaryotic cell is not dividing. When the cells
                                divide, chromatin condenses and becomes visible as chromosomes.
