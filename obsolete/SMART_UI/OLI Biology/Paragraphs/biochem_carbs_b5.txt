Glycogen, starch (amylose and amylopectin), and cellulose are all made of many
					linked glucose monomers. Glycogen is mainly used for energy storage in animals.
					Starch is mainly used for energy storage in plants. Cellulose is mainly used for
					maintaining plant structure. These three molecules are all made of glucose, so
					why do they have such different functions? The main difference is how the
					glucose monomers are linked together. This is a prime example of one of the
					central themes of biology: form affects function.
