Reversible — bound ligands can be released by the protein.
Concentration dependent — the level of binding depends on the ligand concentration. As the
				ligand concentration increases, so does the amount of protein bound.
Limited — once all of the proteins are ligand bound, no additional ligand can bind and the
				protein is said to be saturated.
