Based on these discoveries, scientists are interested in learning more about the
            chemistry and therapeutic potential of daffodils. But where to look? There are up to 150
            different species of Narcissus and countless varieties. It would
            be inefficient and much too costly to do a full analysis on every species. Instead,
            researchers are using “tree thinking” to narrow down the search. Future testing will
            focus on close relatives of species that are already known to be chemically rich.
