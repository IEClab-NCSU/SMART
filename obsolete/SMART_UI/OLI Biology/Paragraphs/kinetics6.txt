 Enzymes and other catalysts lower the activation energy for converting a
					specific substrate to product, as shown in the graph below. The activation
					energy is the energy required for a chemical reaction to proceed to product. By
					lowering the activation energy, a chemical reaction can proceed much more
					quickly. Note that enzymes have no effect on the free energy of the reaction.
					Enzymes are not consumed in the process, but are recycled for further
					catalysis.
