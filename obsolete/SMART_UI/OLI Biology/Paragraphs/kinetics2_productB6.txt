 In this equation, kcat is the rate at which the [ES] complex decays
					to product. Vmax is kcat multiplied by the total
					amount of enzyme, Et. It is therefore the maximum velocity at which
					the reaction can occur under a fixed enzyme concentration. Km is also
					a constant that reflects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate and is an
					approximation of the dissociation equilibrium constant. Both kcat and
						Km depend on the particular enzyme and substrate.
