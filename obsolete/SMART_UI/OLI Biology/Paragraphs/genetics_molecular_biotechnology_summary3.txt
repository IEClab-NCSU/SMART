A synthetic gene is chemically synthesized using the known amino acid
                        sequence of the target protein (HuGH) to determine the required DNA
                        sequence. In cases where the genetic code is redundant (more than one codon
                        specifies a single amino acid), those codons preferred by bacteria are
                        selected when designing the synthetic DNA. 
The synthetic DNA is inserted into an expression plasmid, using a
                        combination of restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase. The expression
                        plasmid contains DNA segments that are responsible for replication of the
                        plasmid and a gene that confers antibiotic resistance to bacteria. The
                        expression plasmid also contains the required signals for the initiation,
                        regulation, and termination of mRNA from the inserted synthetic gene. 
The expression plasmid is transferred into bacteria. Antibiotic is added to
                        the culture medium so that only those bacteria containing the plasmid can
                        grow.
The bacteria are cultured under conditions that favor rapid growth. The
                        production of mRNA is initiated by the addition of lactose to the culture.
                        Useful quantities of the final product - human growth hormone - can now be
                        extracted from the medium. 
The process above can be used to produce human insulin or virtually any
                        other protein in bacteria, simply by changing the DNA sequence of the
                        synthetic gene. A similar process is used to produce proteins in yeast or
                        mammalian cells for biomedical applications.
