Nucleic acids are macromolecules that carry out two main functions in the cell: storage of
			genetic information and synthesis of proteins. Two types of nucleic acids specialize in
			these functions: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the
			genetic material that stores information for making proteins in all living organisms.
			Some viruses store their genetic information in RNA instead of DNA. This may seem as an
			exception to the universal use of DNA as genetic material; however, viruses are not
			cellular, and are not considered living organisms. DNA is found in the nucleus
			of eukaryotes and in two cellular organelles: chloroplasts, and
				mitochondria.
