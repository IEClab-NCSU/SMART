If you add some salt to water, you are making a solution. Water is the solvent and the salt is the
				solute. Solutions can
			have more than one solute. If you add sugar to your salt solution, both sugar and salt
			would be the solutes of the solution. Solutions in which water is the solvent are called
				aqueous solutions. The inside of our cells and
			our body fluids are examples of aqueous solutions. When a solute is added to a solvent
			and a solution is formed; the
			solute is described as “dissolving” in the solvent.
