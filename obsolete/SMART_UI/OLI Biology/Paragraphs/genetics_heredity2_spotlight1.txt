Characteristics that are influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors
                    are called multifactorial. The idea of “nature versus nurture” — in
                    other words, the relative influence of genetics versus environmental factors —
                    has been and still is debated. Just looking at the genes of a given organism
                    will not determine how that organism will develop and act. Even identical twins
                    will show different characteristics, depending on the environment in which they
                    live. Everyone is a product of their environment as well as their genetics.
