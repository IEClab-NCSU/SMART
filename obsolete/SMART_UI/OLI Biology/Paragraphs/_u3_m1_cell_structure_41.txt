Both animal and plant cells are eukaryotic cells. However, they both
			contain some specialized structures. Plants have chloroplasts and
			a rigid cell wall. Chloroplasts are unique organelles able
			to harvest solar energy to make sugars from carbon dioxide. This process, called
				photosynthesis, is the basis of life as we know it on
			our planet. This process is possible due to the presence of special pigments, called
			chlorophylls, which are found in the chloroplasts.
