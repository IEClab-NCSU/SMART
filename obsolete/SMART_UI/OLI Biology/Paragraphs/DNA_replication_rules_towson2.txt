The Challenge: To initiate the DNA replication of a chromosome the appropriate
          substrate conditions must be met as described previously. How long the process of
          replication takes is also important to the cell. How genomes of variable sizes can be
          totally replicated within the appropriate life cycle time of the cell is a significant
          challenge.
