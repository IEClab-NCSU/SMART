Skeletal Formulas: Chains of carbon atoms are very common in
							carbon-based molecules. Sometimes such molecules are drawn using
							skeletal formulas, also known as shorthand formulas. In these diagrams,
							the carbon atom, typically indicated with the letter “C” , is not shown.
							Instead, each C atom is drawn simply as a corner on the diagram.
