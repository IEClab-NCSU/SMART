ATP is an
					important molecule in biological systems because of its high energy phosphate
					bonds. Energy is stored as chemical energy. Energy is released when ATP reacts
					with water to form ADP or AMP. Here's how: Cells gain energy stored in ATP by
					transferring the terminal phosphate group. The chemical bond between the last
					two phosphates is unstable, and reactions that involve the removal of the
					terminal (last) phosphate release energy. This bond can be broken in a reaction
					involving water. This reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction ("hydro" means "water" and "lysis" means "separation"; together they mean "using water to
					separate"). The products of this reaction are inorganic phosphate (P) and adenosine diphosphate
						(ADP), which has only two phosphate groups. Taken together, ADP and P
					are more stable than ATP. The net result of ATP hydrolysis is the release of
					energy. This process is illustrated in the animation below.
