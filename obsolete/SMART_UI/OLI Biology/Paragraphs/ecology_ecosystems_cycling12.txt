Humans now play a huge role in the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.  Today, artificial fertilizer production fixes more nitrogen than all natural processes combined.  Phosphate mining removes phosphorus from storage in rocks much more quickly than natural uplift and erosion.  Fertilizers run off farm fields and enter water bodies directly; human and animal wastes also deliver excess nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies.  The result is eutrophication, the overfertilization of aquatic ecosystems by humans.  Excess ammonium can kill fish.  Extra phosphates and nitrates fuel blooms of algae and cyanobacteria.  These turn water pea-soup green and can lead to fish kills and other negative effects.
