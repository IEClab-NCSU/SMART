If the restriction enzyme does not cut at the center of its recognition sequence the
            cleavage products will contain short single-stranded segments of DNA. These are often
            called “sticky-ends” because they can stick to other DNA molecules that have
            complementary sticky ends. Enzymes that cut in the middle of their recognition sequences
            produce blunt end fragments.
