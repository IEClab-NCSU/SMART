In this module, you will learn about the basic structure of the atom, the fundamental unit
			of  matter. Living things are
			made up of atoms arranged in a complex and nonrandom way. This is one of the common
			features of all living organisms. The atom is the smallest level in the  hierarchy of life that we will
			explore in this course. Understanding the properties of atoms allows us to predict and
			understand how atoms interact with one another to build molecules, such as hormones and
			DNA. In addition, an understanding of atoms allows us to predict how cells will react to
			different therapeutic drugs and toxins in the environment.
