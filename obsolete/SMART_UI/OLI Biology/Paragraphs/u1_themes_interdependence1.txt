Have you ever played a game of Jenga, where you try to remove one block
                            at a time from a tower structure without causing the entire tower to
                            collapse? In this game, each block depends on the other blocks for
                            stability, and if youâ€™re not careful, the removal of a single block can
                            cause the destruction of the entire structure. Life is much the same. At
                            levels from the individual to the biosphere, the various parts of living
                            systems are interdependent.
