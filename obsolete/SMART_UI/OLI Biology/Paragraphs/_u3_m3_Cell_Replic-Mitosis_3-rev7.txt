The centromere is the region in the center of the X-shaped chromosomes. Each half
					of the X is a copy of the same DNA strand. The centromere contains proteins that
					hold together these two copies and can bind to the microtubules. The proteins on
					the centromere are called the kinetochore, and the microtubules that attach to
					them are called kinetochore microtubules. The microtubules that are not attached
					to the kinetochores are called nonkinetochore microtubules.
