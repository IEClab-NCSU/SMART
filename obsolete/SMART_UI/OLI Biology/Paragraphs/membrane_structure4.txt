The extracellular surface of the cell membrane is decorated with
									carbohydrate groups attached to lipids and proteins.
									Carbohydrates are added to lipids and proteins by a process
									called glycosylation, and are called glycolipids or
									glycoproteins. These short carbohydrates, or oligosaccharides,
									are usually chains of 15 or fewer sugar molecules.
									Oligosaccharides give a cell identity (i.e., distinguishing self
									from non-self) and are the distinguishing factor in human blood
									types and transplant rejection.
