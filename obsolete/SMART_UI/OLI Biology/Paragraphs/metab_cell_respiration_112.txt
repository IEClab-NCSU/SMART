The electron carriers NADH and FADH2 carry high energy electrons.
					These electrons are passed to proteins on the inner membrane of the
					mitochondria. These high energy electrons are passed from one protein to the
					next. At each stage, the electrons lose energy. This loss in energy is used to
					create a concentration gradient of protons (H+). This concentration
					gradient is used to build ATP. The final electron acceptor in the electron
					transport chain is oxygen. Oxygen binds with the electron and loose H+ to
					produce water. Without the electron transport chain, NADH does not get broken
					down to NAD+ and glycolysis would not be able to continue.
					Fermentation uses the same pathway as glycolysis, but adds an additional step to
					recycle NADH. This allows the process of fermentation to continue. While
					glycolysis and the citric acid cycle produce a few molecules of ATP, the
					electron transport chain can produce over 30 ATP molecules. This is the main
					source of ATP for cellular respiration.
