In the diagram above, you see the physical behavior of two different triglycerides (with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) at three distinct
			temperatures. Figure 1 shows that at a temperature of 0oC (freezing), both
			types of fatty acids stack neatly. At 16oC (Fig. 2), the unsaturated fatty
			acids lose the tightly stacked formation and become more mobile. At 70oC, the
			saturated fatty acids also become mobile (Fig.3). At 27oC (room temperature)
			and at 37oC (body temperature), triglycerides with unsaturated fatty acids
			are liquid oils, whereas saturated fats remain solid.
