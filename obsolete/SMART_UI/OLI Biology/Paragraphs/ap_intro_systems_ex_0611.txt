Arteries of the systemic circuit (also known as the
                    systemic circulatory circuit) carry oxygenated blood from your heart to provide
                    oxygen and nutrients dissolved in the blood to every cell in your body. When
                    blood leaves the left ventricle it first enters the aorta, the largest artery in
                    the human body. Arteries gradually branch into smaller and more numerous
                    arterioles which then supply blood to the smallest vessels, termed capillaries.
                    It is estimated that your body contains approximately 60,000 miles of
                    capillaries, that is enough to encircle earth three times! Capillaries allow the
                    exchange of oxygen, nutrients and waste between the blood and tissue cells. After waste has been picked up, blood
                    is moved through vessels of increasing size venules into the larger veins. Veins return
                    oxygen-poor blood back to the heart, where the blood is passed to the pulmonary
                    circuit to the lungs to pick up oxygen.
