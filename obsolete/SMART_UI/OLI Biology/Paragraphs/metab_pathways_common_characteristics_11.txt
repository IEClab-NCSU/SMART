In the previous modules, you learned about metabolic pathways in cells — those “freeways”
			that shuttle energy and carbon in different directions. Metabolic pathways can be either
			anabolic or catabolic. Anabolic pathways build things up and catabolic pathways break them back
			down again, sometimes as a source of energy, other times to obtain building materials.
			Among the main pathways of the cell are photosynthesis and cellular
				respiration, although there are a variety of alternative pathways such as
			fermentation.
