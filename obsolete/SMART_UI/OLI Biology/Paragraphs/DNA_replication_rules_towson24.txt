Current methods of DNA sequencing rely on understanding the substrate requirements of DNA
          polymerase and the concept of competition. To sequence DNA as with PCR it is necessary to
          create single stranded DNA that will act as the template. It is generally required that to
          ensure valid DNA sequence, a double stranded segment of DNA should be sequenced in both
          directions using primers at each of sequence to be defined. These primers are the
          equivalent of the forward and reverse primers of PCR. However, where PCR replicates both
          strands simultaneously, DNA sequencing is performed on each strand individually. Starting
          with the single stranded template and the bound primer with a free 3â€™ hydroxyl, the
          conditions are set for DNA polymerase to replicate the DNA.
