As they take up and release energy, growing organisms also absorb chemical nutrients and
			release chemical wastes. There is a continuous exchange of material between the living
			and nonliving portions of the ecosystem. Each chemical element retains its integrity but
			takes on many different forms as chemical bonds are formed and broken. To see how this
			material recycling takes place, think about a leaf on a tree. Its living tissue contains
			organic molecules rich in carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus
			(P), sulfur (S), and other elements. In autumn, the leaf dies and falls to the ground.
			Over time, the leaf decays. Bacteria and fungi feed on the leaf material. In the
			process, its large organic molecules are broken down to simpler inorganic molecules.
			Focusing on just one element, the nitrogen atoms that were in the leaf are now released
			to the soil as ammonium (NH4+). To complete the cycle back to life, plants take up
			ammonium through their roots and use its nitrogen to make proteins and nucleic acids.
			Thus, nitrogen has cycled between the biotic and abiotic components of the
			ecosystem.
