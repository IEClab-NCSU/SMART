An organelle found in plants and photosynthetic protists
                                (single-Celled eukaryotic organisms) which contain pigments such as
                                chlorophyl. Its primary function is to capture solar energy and
                                convert it into chemical energy through the process of
                                photosynthesis. Chloroplast absorbs sunlight energy and uses the
                                energy to power the synthesis of organic food molecules (sugars). A
                                chloroplast contains its own DNA as a single circular chromosome.
