This course is divided into 10 units. This first unit, "Biology: The Science of Life,"
			lays the foundation upon which the rest of the course is built. This unit begins by
			defining biology and characterizing its relationship to other fields of scientific
			study. It then elaborates on a few of the themes that emerge over and over throughout
			this course. Finally, in this unit you will explore the nature of science. This
			introduction represents the toolkit youâ€™ll need to understand the rest of the course,
			and will enable you to create context for all the new information you will learn.
