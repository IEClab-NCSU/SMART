The step of inserting our synthetic DNA into the plasmid use two very important enzymes,
            restriction enzymes and DNA ligase. Restriction endonucleases are
                enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequences, such as GAATTC, and cut
            both strands of the DNA within these sequences. Typically four or six bases are
            recognized. Restriction enzymes are isolated from a number of bacterial
            species and the name of the enzyme reflects the original species. For example, the
            restriction enzyme EcoR1 was isolated from Escherichia coli. The
            normal biological function of restriction endonucleases is to protect the bacterial
            species from viruses by digesting the viral DNA as it enters the cell. Of
            course, the bacteria shouldnâ€™t digest their own DNA. Consequently, they have companion
            enzymes called DNA methylases, which add methyl groups to the bacterial
            DNA, protecting it from digestion.
