There are four classes of biological macromolecules that we will study in this course:
				carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and
				nucleic acids. These macromolecules are probably already familiar to
			you, because they make up the nutrients you ingest every time you eat. In this way, you
			provide your cells with the building materials and energy necessary to sustain life. In
			the next unit, we will use these fundamental building blocks to form the cell, the first level
			of organization that shows all the characteristics of life.
