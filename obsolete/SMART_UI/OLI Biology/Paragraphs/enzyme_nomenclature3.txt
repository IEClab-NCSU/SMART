Each enzyme has a unique name.  Usually, the name of an enzymes is systematic, but many exceptions
      exist.  Almost all enzyme names have the suffix ase, indicating that they are an enzyme, for
      example kinase, lyase, phosphatase, etc. Usually, but unfortunately
      not always, the name of the enzyme is derived from the nature of the chemical change that it
      catalyzes. For example, an enzyme that oxidizes its substrate is referred to as a
      dehydrogenase because it removes hydrogens atoms during the oxidation process.
