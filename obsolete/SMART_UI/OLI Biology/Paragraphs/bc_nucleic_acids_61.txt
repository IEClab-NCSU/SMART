Bases form pairs (base pairs) in a very specific way. The figure
			shows how A (Adenine) pairs with T (Thymine) and G (Guanine)
				pairs with C (Cytosine). This is an example of bioselectivity: T pairs with A, and not with
			C. The molecular recognition occurs because of the ability of bases to form specific
			hydrogen bonds: atoms align just right to make hydrogen bonds possible.
