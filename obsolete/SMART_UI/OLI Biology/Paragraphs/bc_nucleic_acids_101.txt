Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units of nucleotides that direct
					cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis. Each
						nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base,
					and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA.
						DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on
					from parents to offspring. It has a double-helix structure with the two strands
					running in opposite directions and complementary to each other. RNA
					is composed of a single strand and it is involved in protein synthesis. RNA is
					composed of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a
						phosphate group. ATP is a nucleotide composed of an adenine
					base, ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups; it provides energy for cellular
					activities.
