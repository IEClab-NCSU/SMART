Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are
					catalyzed by enzymes. At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins
					embrace substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to
					an enzymeâ€™s active site. As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the
					reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes,
					metabolism would grind to a halt. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of
					enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of
					the metabolic pathways they participate in. A huge diversity of enzymes is
					required to run the metabolic
						reactions necessary to maintain even a single cell.
