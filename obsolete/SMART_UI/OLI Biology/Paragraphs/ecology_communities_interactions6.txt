Competition is a lose-lose, or mutually harmful, relationship
			between two species. Two species are competitors if each would be better off alone.
			Clear examples of competition are often seen among plants that require very similar
			resources, such as light, water, and certain mineral nutrients. Animals may compete for
			space, sometimes fighting directly for territory or simply excluding each other from
			living sites. Animals that eat similar foods may also sometimes make life harder for
			each other, though here the degree of competition is often limited because each species
			may eat slightly different foods.
