Prokaryotic cells have a simpler structure than eukaryotic cells, and they range in diameter
			from 0.1 to 5.0 Âµm (micrometers). Most prokaryotes have a protective layer called the
				cell wall that is made of peptidoglycan, which is a
			combination of polysaccharides and amino acids. Prokaryotes also have a cell membrane
			and cytoplasm. Many prokaryotes also have external appendages such as a flagellum. The cytoplasm contains the DNA and the ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place. Several types of RNA are
			involved in the process of protein synthesis, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the main
			component of ribosomes. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have ribosomes, but they are
			different. Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller and lighter than their eukaryotic
			counterparts.
