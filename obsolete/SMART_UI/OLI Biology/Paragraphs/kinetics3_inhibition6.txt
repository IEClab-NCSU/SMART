 The second effect of temperature is to cause proteins to denature (unfold).
					Denaturation means that the protein loses the secondary, tertiary, and
					quaternary structure required for function. As discussed earlier, the protein
					tertiary structure is stabilized by non-covalent bonding. As with substrate
					binding, increased temperature can provide the energy necessary to break the
					weak non-covalent bonds. In some cases, the beaking of a single hydrogen bond
					can alter the structure of the enzyme sufficiently to cause the loss of function
					(i.e. loss of the ability to bind substrate, to recognize the substrate or to
					catalyze product formation).
