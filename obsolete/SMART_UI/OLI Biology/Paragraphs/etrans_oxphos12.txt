The mechanism of ATP synthase is such that the enzyme generates one ATP molecule every
          time 3 protons are transferred back to the matrix from the inter-membrane space. Since the
          standard energy for the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi is +30 kJ/mol the transport of
          three protons must release at least 30kJ/mol in order to provide enough energy to
          synthesize ATP. The amount of energy that is stored in the protein gradient can be
          obtained by calculating the Gibbs free energy. If the products are defined as the protons
          that have been transported to the matrix, the formula is:
