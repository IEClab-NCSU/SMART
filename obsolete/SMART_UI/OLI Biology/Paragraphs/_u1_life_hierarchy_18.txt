All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively
					called a population. For example, a forest may include
					many pine trees. All those pine trees represent the population of pine trees in
					this area. Many different populations live in any specific area. All of these
					populations can interact with each other in positive and negative ways, and
					together they form a community. For example, the forest
					with pine trees includes populations of flowers, mammals, birds, insects, fungi,
					and bacteria, all of which can interact. An ecosystem
					consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the
					abiotic, non-living part of that environment. So the pine forest ecosytem
					includes not just plants, animals, and microbes but also rocks, water,
					temperature changes, air chemistry, and other abiotic factors that interact with
					life in the area. At the highest level of organization, the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems on Earth. It is Earth’s
					habitable zone and includes land, soil, and rocks to a great depth in the
					Earth’s crust; water and ice; and the atmosphere to great height.
