A structure surrounding all types of cells, separating it from the
                                external environment. It constitutes a semipermeable boundary, where
                                certain substances can cross and others cannot. Chemically, the
                                plasma membrane (also called the cell membrane) is a double
                                layer of phospholipids (phospholipid
                                    bilayer) in which proteins, and sometimes sterols, are
                                embedded.
