When the normal pH levels of the body are disrupted, there are detriments to the health of
			the organism. For instance, the female vaginal tract is moderately acidic, with a pH
			between 3.8 and 4.5. When the pH increases in this area of the body (becomes more
			basic), women are more prone to bacterial infections of the vagina. Conversely, if the
			pH decreases (becomes more acidic), women are more prone to yeast infections.
