Cells continually encounter changes in their external environment. Most cells have a similar
			blend of solutes within them, but external fluids can vary dramatically, from pure water
			to brine or syrup. What will happen if there is a strong concentration gradient between
			a cell's interior and the fluid outside? As you know, molecules will tend to move down
			their concentration gradients until equilibrium is reached. You might think that solutes
			will flow into our out of the cell until the solute concentrations are equal across the
			membrane. However, not all molecules can pass through the cell membrane. The plasma
			membrane (lipid bilayer) is significantly less permeable to most solutes than it is to
			water. Therefore the WATER tends to flow in a way that establishes an equal
			concentration of solutes on either side of the membrane. The water flows down its own
			concentration gradient, with a net movement toward the region that has a higher
			concentration of solutes. This movement of water across a semipermeable membrane in
			response to an imbalance of solute is called osmosis.
