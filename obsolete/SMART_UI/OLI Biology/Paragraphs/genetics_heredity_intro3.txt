In this unit, we will focus on a direct link between genetic information and visible
            traits. This will allow us to discuss how genetic information can be passed from one
            generation to the next and how these genes affect the later generation. We will focus on
            simple examples of traits that are clearly visible and have a direct correlation to
            genetics.
