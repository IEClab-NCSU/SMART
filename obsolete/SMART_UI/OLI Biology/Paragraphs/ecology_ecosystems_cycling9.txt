Nitrogen is cycled mainly through biological processes.  The atmosphere is a huge reservoir of nitrogen; it is almost 80% N2 gas.  However, most life forms cannot use nitrogen gas.  Plants and algae obtain nitrogen as nitrate (NO3âˆ’) or ammonium (NH4+).  These compounds dissolve in water and are absorbed directly (algae) or taken up through the roots (plants).  Bacteria are the key intermediaries that drive the nitrogen cycle.  Some bacteria, called nitrogen fixers, transform N2 gas to ammonium that plants can use.  Bacterial and fungal decomposers break down dead organic matter and also generate ammonium.  In traditional and organic agriculture, plant and animal wastes (particularly manure) are collected and composted to favor the activity of decomposers and nitrifying bacteria.  The resulting nitrate-rich compost is spread on fields, providing usable nitrogen to crop plants.
