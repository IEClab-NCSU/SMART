Mutations alter RNA and may alter protein molecules. If a protein molecule is
				changed, the altered molecule may work just the same as the original, it may be
				totally nonfunctional, or it may work more efficiently than before.
Some mutations cause genetic disorders, abnormalities, and cancer, while others
				merely contribute to normal variation of traits in a species (such as freckles,
				widowâ€™s peaks, and eye color variations).
Some mutations are harmful because they encode a trait that decreases an organism's
				chances of survival, while others are beneficial because they encode an adaptive
				trait that increases an organism's chances of survival.
The effect of a mutation upon an organism can depend upon the environment in which
				the organism lives. In fact, some mutations that have no immediate effect on
				survival can be maintained in a gene pool, and as conditions change become
				advantageous or disadvantageous long after the initial mutation occurred.
