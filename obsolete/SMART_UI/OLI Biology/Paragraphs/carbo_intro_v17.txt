 Another example is the peptido-glycan that makes up the cell wall structure of a
					bacterium. Peptido refers to a peptide, which is a fragment of a protein or a
					short polymer of amino acids, and glycan refers to a polysaccharide, a polymer
					of carbohydrates. In this case, the polymer of carbohydrates includes building
					blocks other than glucose, but the end result is the formation of a matrix. In
					both cases the resulting fibers and matrices provide scaffolding that gives
					rigidity (structure) and protection to the organisms with which they are
					associated.
