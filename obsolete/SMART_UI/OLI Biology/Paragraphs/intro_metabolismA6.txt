In this section of the course we will investigate in some detail the production of energy
      from glucose and how this process is regulated to maintain homeostasis. Since the entire
      process of metabolism is complex, it is useful to discuss the general features of the
      metabolic pathways that are involved in converting sugars, amino acids, and fats to energy.
      Important features of pathways include:
