Even when influenced by the environment, phenotypes have a normal range of
                    expression. For instance, human height varies based on nutrition and genetics,
                    but not many people are shorter than 4Â½ feet or taller than 7 feet. The range of
                    phenotypic possibilities is called the norm of reaction. Hydrangeas,
                    for example, may be blue, pink, or purple, but they are never naturally orange.
                    Hydrangeas are blue in acidic soil with available aluminum, and they are pink in
                    alkaline soil without available aluminum.
