The clearest line separating pseudoscience from “real” science is publication in
                    peer-reviewed scientific journals. These are publications, usually run by
                    scientific societies or academic publishing companies, in which scientists
                    publish their findings according to a well-established system of oversight.
                    Before it gets published in such a journal, a piece of research is carefully
                    reviewed by two or more researchers in the same field of study. The methods and
                    logic of the paper are evaluated carefully, and if it makes bold or unusual
                    claims, the study is subject to especially close scrutiny. Reviewers and editors
                    may demand not just rewrites, but also additional evidence if a claim is weakly
                    supported.
