Population density is the total number of individuals of a species
			per unit area or volume within a specified habitat or region. In many cases this number
			can be pictured and measured more easily than population size itself. It also can be
			used to compare populations that occupy areas of different size, allowing you to judge
			where a population is more or less crowded.
