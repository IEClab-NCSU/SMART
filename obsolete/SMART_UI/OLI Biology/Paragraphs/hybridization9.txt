While the melting temperature does not tell us anything about the proteins that are coded by the DNA, it does tell us something about the tolerance of the organism in which the DNA is found. For example, thermophilic bacteria (those that survive at extremely high temperatures) have DNA with very high Tm values so that their DNA does not melt at their normal environmental temperature. As we will see later, this also has implications for how the same proteins can be made in two different organisms using DNA with vastly different compositions.
