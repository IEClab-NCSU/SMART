Scientific processes are both creative and imaginative. Creativity and imagination are
                    sources of innovation and inspiration in science. In fact, creativity and imagination are integral to all
                    aspects of a scientist’s work – making sense of observations, making a creative leap from data to possible
                    explanation, designing investigations, or looking at old data in new ways.
