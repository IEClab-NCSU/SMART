Hydrogen bonding was covered in Water -- Hydrogen Bonding (go there now.) Remember
					that hydrogen bonding occurs between partially negatively charged
					electronegative atoms, and partially positively charged hydrogen atoms that are
					attached to electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Hydrogen
					bonding is a critical bonding in the cell. It is the principal bonding that
					holds the tertiary structure of proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids
					together and the overall stability of these molecules is due in part to the
					cumulative effect of the large number of hydrogen bonds found in the functional
					structures. Hydrogen bonds are found in and between a variety of molecules. For
					example, the enormous number of hydrogen bonds between strands of cellulose
					provide the strength and structure of the plant cell wall.
