The perplexing thing about sexual selection is that the showy traits that are
					used to attract a mate can also interfere with survival. For instance, the
					elaborate plumage of the peacock can make the males more likely targets for
					predators. Elk with larger antlers may get them stuck in fences or brambles,
					which can lead to the untimely death of the stuck elk. And fighting is never good for survival.
