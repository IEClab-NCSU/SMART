You measure a known amount of double stranded DNA at body temperature (37°C) and
        get an absorbance reading indicated at point A on the graph below. You take that same
        concentration of DNA and raise the temperature to 65°C, when you measure the absorbance
        you get the reading indicated at point B. You take that same concentration of DNA and
        increase the temperature once more to 95°C, when you measure the absorbance you get
        the reading indicated at point C.
