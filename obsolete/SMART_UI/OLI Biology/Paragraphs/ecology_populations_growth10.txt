The table and graph above depict a pattern of change called exponential
				growth. In exponential growth, a quantity grows by a constant percentage each time step. As the quantity gets larger, so does
			the actual amount of growth that occurs. Some familiar examples
			of exponential growth involve finances. A bank account may earn 1% of its value in
			interest each year.When the bank accountâ€™s value is $100, 1% amounts to a dollar. But if
			the account already contains $1 million, a gain of 1% brings in $10,000!
