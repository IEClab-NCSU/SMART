As a scientific theory, evolution is more than a mere opinion or guess. In science, a
            “theory” is a broad explanation that is supported by a great deal of evidence and
            continues to inspire productive research. Scientists accept and use evolutionary theory
            because it is so strongly supported by evidence from many different sources. It fits our
            observations of the diversity and variability of physical traits in animals in different
            settings. The theory is now also supported by consistent and reproducible data gathered
            from fossils, a detailed understanding of the skeletal and organ structure of living
            organisms, and our twenty-first century abilities to examine and determine the structure
            and function of proteins and DNA in living things. Since the theory of evolution was
            first put forth in the 1850s and since some of the supporting evidence is based in
            ancient fossils, you might get the impression that evolution occurred in the past and is
            complete. That is not correct. In fact, evolution continues all around us today and
            evolutionary ideas are being applied to solve a huge range of problems of both academic
            and practical interest! Below are a few examples. You will learn about some of them in
            this unit. Evolutionary theory and models are used to:
