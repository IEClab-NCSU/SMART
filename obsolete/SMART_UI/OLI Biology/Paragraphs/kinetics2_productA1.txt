In the last section, the action of an enzyme was described as taking place in two
					parts. The first part involves the binding of substrate to enzyme in a
					reversible equilibrium as modeled in the way of ligand binding. The second part
					involves the conversion of the [ES] complex to product and the release of the
					product from the enzyme. This step represents the catalysis step in the enzyme
					catalyzed reaction. These parts are illustrated in the overall reaction below:
