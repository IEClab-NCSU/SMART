In animals, excess glucose molecules are linked together (through an anabolic
					pathway) to make a long branching polysaccharide called glycogen. Glycogen is primarily stored in the liver, with small
					amounts being stored in the muscles. Once glycogen stores are filled, the body
					begins storing excess food calories as fat. Conversely, when food intake is
					insufficient to keep up with energy requirements, the body will break down its
					glycogen stores to release individual glucose monosaccharides.
