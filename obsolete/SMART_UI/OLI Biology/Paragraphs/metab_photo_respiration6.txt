The photosynthesis / cellular respiration cycle isnâ€™t restricted to the cells of an
					individual plant. To the contrary, it is a global cycle that makes all life on
					Earth interdependent. A growing photosynthetic producer carries out more
					photosynthesis than cellular respiration. Thus, it releases excess oxygen into
					the atmosphere and stores carbohydrates and other molecules in its body as
					growth. These materials are essential to virtually all other life forms on
					Earth. This interdependence is depicted in the diagram below.
