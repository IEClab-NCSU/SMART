The above reaction is an incomplete description of a redox reaction because it does not
      indicate the fate of the electrons that were obtained from iron. Since free electrons
      generally cannot exist, all oxidation reactions must be coupled to a corresponding reduction.
      Since the above reaction only describes one-half of the reaction it is referred to as a
        half-reaction. The oxidation of iron could be coupled to the reduction of copper
      ions, which is described by the following half-reaction:
