Weak acids can act as pH buffers when the pH is within approximately one
							unit of the pKa for the acid. A buffer solution will resist
							changes in pH as a strong acid or base is added to the solution. The
							following shows the pH of a solution of a weak acid as a strong base,
							e.g. hydroxide, is added or titrated into the solution.
