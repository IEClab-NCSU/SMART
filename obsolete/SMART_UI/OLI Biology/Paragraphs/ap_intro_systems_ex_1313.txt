The autonomic nervous system monitors and regulates changes
                            in the body's internal environment. These changes are not under
                            voluntary control. Body processes controlled by the autonomic nervous
                            system include the contractions of the stomach and other digestive
                            organs, the heart rate, and contractions of blood vessels to control
                            blood pressure and flow though the body.
