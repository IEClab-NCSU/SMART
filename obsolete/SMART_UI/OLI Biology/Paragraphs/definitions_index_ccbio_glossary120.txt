The pattern of energy flow in an ecosystem from producers (bottom of
                                the pyramid) to the highest trophic level consumer (levels 2 and up)
                                -- where only about 10% of the available energy in one trophic level
                                is incorporated and stored as calories in the bodies of the next
                                level up. The result of this is a pyramid in which energy
                                availability decreases as the trophic levels increase. Remember that
                                any energy not transferred to the next higher trophic level is
                                released as undigested materials in feces or is dissipated as heat.
