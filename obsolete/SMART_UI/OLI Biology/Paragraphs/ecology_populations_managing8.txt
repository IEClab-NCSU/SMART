Endangered species and fisheries management are just a few of the areas in which
			principles of population ecology are applied to solve real-world problems. Pest
			management is often a very challenging exercise because pest species tend to reproduce
			very rapidly and show a boom-and-bust pattern of growth. Even if we can induce a
			bust—say, by spraying an insecticide—the population is likely to rebound with another
			boom unless we can reduce the birth rate. Effective pest management often requires that
			several strategies be used together with careful monitoring of the pest population.
