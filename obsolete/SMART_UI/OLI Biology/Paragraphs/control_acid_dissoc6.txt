When pH = pKa, one half of the molecules will be
								protonated
When the pH is one unit lower than the pKa 90% of the
								molecules will be protonated.
When the pH is one unit higher than the pKa only 10% of
								the molecules are protonated.
For pH values outside +/-1 pH unit from the pKa the group
								is essentially fully protonated (pH << pKa) or
								fully deprotonated (pH >> pKa)
