 The drawing below shows not only the possible structures resulting from the ring closure
			but also shows the more traditional representation of these structures in their ring
			configuration. In all of these cases the structure is still ribose. The two new
			structures created by the ring closure create two additional conformations of the number
			one carbon: alpha with the hydroxyl on the right of the stick structure or pointing down
			in the ring representation, and beta with the hydroxyl on the left of the stick
			structure and pointing up in the ring structure. It should also be noted that as
			represented in the drawing these structures are all in equilibrium with each other and
			the alpha structure can be converted to the beta structure and visa versa as long as
			each structure can be converted to the free aldehyde structure.
