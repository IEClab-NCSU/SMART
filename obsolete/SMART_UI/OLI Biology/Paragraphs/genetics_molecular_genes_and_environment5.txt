Heritable changes in gene expression can occur via changes in DNA sequence or in
                    DNA packaging. Mutations in regulatory regions of the gene can lead to increased
                    or decreased protein production without affecting the amino acid sequence of the
                    protein. One example of such mutation is found in the regulatory region of the
                    human LCT gene on chromosome 2. The LCT gene codes for the enzyme lactase,
                    required for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose. In many adults,
                    expression of the LCT gene is turned off or turned down, resulting in little or
                    no lactase production. Lack of lactase in the intestines can lead to
                    gastrointestinal distress (bloating, cramps, diarrhea, etc.) after consumption
                    of moderate to large amounts of dairy products, giving rise to a condition
                    called lactose intolerance. Other people are able to
                    produce lactase well into adulthood. This ability has been linked to mutations
                    in the regulatory region of the lactase gene that allow gene expression to
                    continue after childhood.
