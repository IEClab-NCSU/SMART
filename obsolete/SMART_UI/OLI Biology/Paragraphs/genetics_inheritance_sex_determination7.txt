Morgan did crosses between the F1 hybrids, and he observed the following: 75 percent of
            the offspring were red-eyed, and 25 percent were white-eyed. So far, the results
            supported the Mendelian pattern of 3:1. But then he noticed something odd: all of the
            white-eyed flies were male.
