An understanding of this balance is important in the modern world, with global warming in the
			headlines. Since the late 1700's, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere
			has been rising. This indicates that the natural recycling of carbon has been upset. The
			main source of excess carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels,
			which were created by photosynthesis millions of years ago. Meanwhile, deforestation
			removes photosynthetic organisms (trees) from the surface of the planet. Taken together,
			these human activities have changed Earth’s atmosphere. The carbon dioxide concentration
			of Earth’s air has increased by more than 35 percent since the 1700's. Such changes are
			very likely changing Earth’s climate, and pollution and deforestation also have other
			detrimental effects on environmental health. We will return to explore these topics
			further in the Ecology unit. You will need to use your understanding of photosynthesis
			and respiration to fully grasp these issues.
