Most communities are clearly dependent on one or a few foundation species. But not every
			important species has effects that are so obvious. In ecological communities, many
			interactions are indirect.Indirect interactions, sometimes called
			“ripple effects,” occur through chains of cause and effect. The effect of one species on
			another is said to be indirect if one or more additional species
			are involved in the interaction as intermediaries. Complexity of this sort is a source
			of fascination and challenge for ecologists attempting to unravel how communities
			work.
