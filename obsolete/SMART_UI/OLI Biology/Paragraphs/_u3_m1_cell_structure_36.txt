Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in
			storage and transport. Vesicles are specialized for transport and some other functions.
			Their membranes can fuse with the plasma membrane, thus emptying their contents into the
			extracellular space. Vesicles also may fuse with the membranes of the endoplasmic
			reticulum and Golgi apparatus, thus emptying their contents into those organelles.
			Lysosomes are vesicles found only in animal cells. Lysosomes contain powerful digestive
			enzymes that can recycle cellular parts or destroy external invaders. Vacuoles are
			specialized mainly for storage. Their membranes do not fuse with the membranes of other
			cellular components.
