If a person takes in less calories than required for maintenance and activity,
					glycogen reserves are broken down first. This leads to rapid weight loss early
					on, because each gram of glycogen associates with up to four grams of water. As
					glycogen is broken down, water is released in urine. Most of the initial weight
					loss is actually “water weight.”
