Nucleotides can also differ in the type of sugar they contain. All
					sugars found in nucleotides are pentose sugars, which means they have five
					carbons; however, there can be different pentose sugars. For
					example, DNA
					contains the sugar deoxyribose. RNA, on the other hand,
					contains ribose.
