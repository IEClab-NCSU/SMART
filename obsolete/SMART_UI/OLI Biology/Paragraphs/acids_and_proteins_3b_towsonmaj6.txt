The process in which an enzyme can facilitate a chemical reaction is actually a
                    series of steps termed the catalytic cycle. This cycle is illustrated in the
                    diagram above. Using what you have learned about enzymes match the letter with
                    the correct molecule identification and match the numbers with the correct
                    description of each step of the cycle.
