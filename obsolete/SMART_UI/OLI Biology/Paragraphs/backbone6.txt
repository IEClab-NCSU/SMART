The synthesis of the backbones illustrated above is directed by specific enzymes that
          restrict the possible structures to links between the 3' position and the 5' position of
          the sugars with a bridging phosphate and to selected sugars with specific inclusion of
          either ribose or 2'-deoxyribose.
