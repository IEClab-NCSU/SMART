Fats are a less desirable form of energy storage since the production of energy from fats is slower than the production from glucose.  In addition, a number of tissues in the body, in particular the brain, use glucose as their principal energy source.  Consequently, the enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is tightly regulated.
