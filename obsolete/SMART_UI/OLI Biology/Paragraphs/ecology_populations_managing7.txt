Population models help officials manage fisheries for maximum benefits to commercial
			fishermen and recreational anglers. However, this approach can be risky. Models are not
			the same as reality. Outside factors such as weather events, disease epidemics, and so
			on can sometimes unpredictablydecimate fish populations. With fewer adults in the
			population, the population cannot rebound after a harvest that would normally be
			sustainable. Even just one bad year can set up a series of events in which the
			population dwindles over time. Because of this unpredictability, many fisheries managers
			try to maintain populations at a level that is a bit “too high” (say, 75% of carrying
			capacity) and limit harvest rates accordingly. This reduces the amount of fish that can
			be harvested but it also reduces the risk that harvests will drive the population
			downward.
