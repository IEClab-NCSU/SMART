In this module, you learned about the characteristics that all
							cells have in common, like the cell membrane. You
					also learned about some of the different kinds of cells. You learned about
					eukaryotic cells, which have DNA contained in the
							nucleus, and prokaryotic cells which lack a
							nucleus altogether (though they do not lack DNA).
