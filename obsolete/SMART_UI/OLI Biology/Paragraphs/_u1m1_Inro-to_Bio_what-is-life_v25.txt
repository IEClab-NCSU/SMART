Matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space. All matter can be
					classified in one of two categories: biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living). Matter is considered
					biotic if it was ever alive at some point in time. In this sense, a dead human
					buried underground in a wooden coffin is still biotic, as is the wood used to
					make the coffin (the wood came from a tree that was once alive). However, not
					everything within, or made, by a biotic organism is biotic. For example, urea, a
					chemical component of urine, is an abiotic substance.
