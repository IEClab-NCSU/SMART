In this page we will focus on human effects on the atmosphere and climate as a chief
            example of our ecosystem-level impacts. You have probably heard and learned about global
            warming and global climate change. Through this course we aim to help you improve your
            knowledge about the science behind this issue and clear up any misconceptions you may
            have about it.
