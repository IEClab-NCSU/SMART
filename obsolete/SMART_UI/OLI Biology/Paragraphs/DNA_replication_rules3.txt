 The origin of replication has been described as a specific DNA sequence to
          which initiator protein (DnaA) binds and initiates the process of creating the open
          complex for synthesis. For a typical prokaryotic (bacterial) chromosome there is one
          origin of replication and synthesis proceeds at a rate of approximately 500 bp(base
          pairs)/sec. A bp or base pair is the unit of length of DNA measured in single
          nucleotides or hydrogen bonded base pairs along the polymer chain. Thus if a typical
          bacterial chromosome is 2x10e6 (two million) bp in length then the replication time of the
          chromosome would be about 30 minutes which is consistent with the life cycle of the
          typical bacterial being 30 to 40 minutes.
