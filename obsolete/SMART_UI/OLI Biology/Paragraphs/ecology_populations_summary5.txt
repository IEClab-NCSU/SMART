This is just one of many examples in which people apply principles of population
                    ecology to real-world problems. Conservation of endangered species requires
                    analysis of population changes and action to reduce death rates or increase
                    birth rates. Control of pests and disease agents requires exactly the opposite
                    approach. Management of fisheries or other harvestable resources may involve
                    maintenance of an optimal population size (often about half the carrying
                    capacity) that maximizes rates of growth and reproduction.
