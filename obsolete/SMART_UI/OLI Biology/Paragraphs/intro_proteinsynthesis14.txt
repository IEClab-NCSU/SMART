 During both replication and transcription errors can be made in the incorporation of the
			correct bases during the complementary copying of the DNA. In a previous section a
			discussion of the methods used by the system to minimize these errors has been
			presented. However, even with editing functions, some errors are generated and result in
			changing of the reading code used during translation to a protein sequence. These
			changes are referred to as mutations and can be categorized into four different
			categories described by the end result of the mutation or change.
