Cells must be able to move polar molecules such as nutrients and ions across the lipid
			bilayer of the membrane in order to carry out life processes. But the molecules will
			still move spontaneously down a concentration from high to low concentration. To allow
			the polar molecules, which are not soluble in the lipid bilayer, to pass across the
			 hydrophobic barrier it is necessary to provide ports, channels or holes through the
			membrane. These channels can either allow the molecules to move freely according to
			their concentration differences or they can be gated channels that control the movement
			of the polar molecules according to the needs of the cell. In most cases these channels
			are very discriminatory and will only allow specific molecules to pass; another example
			of bioselectivity. The channels facilitate the movement of molecules that otherwise
			would not be spontaneously permeable to the lipid bilayer. The process of moving
			impermeable molecules across a membrane using channels or pores is referred to as
				facilitated diffusion. Because the molecules are moving down a
			concentration gradient the process is driven by simple diffusion. The following
			simulation depicts the facilitated diffusion of glucose across the membrane using the
			glucose permease transporter.
