Within any organism, there are a multitude of functions taking place at any given time.
            Humans, for example, can breathe, talk, digest food, process visual images, and move
            their bodies all at the same time. While all of these activities are important, some are
            essential to the survival of the human body itself. They are 
vital functions
Our body's anatomy and physiology works together to perform the vital functions
                    that keep us alive
 - processes or actions of the body on which life is directly dependent. You
            will examine four main vital functions in this course: exchange with the environment;
            transport within the body; structure, support, and movement; and control and
            regulation.
