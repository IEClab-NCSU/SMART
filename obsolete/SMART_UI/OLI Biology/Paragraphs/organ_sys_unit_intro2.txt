In this unit on Human Organ Systems, you will learn how the human
            body is able to maintain health and execute the functions of life through the use of
            diverse organs. You will recall that organs and organ systems are important levels in
            the hierarchy of biological organization. In multicellular organisms, cells combine to
            form tissues, like muscle tissue or nervous tissue. Organs are composed of two or more
            kinds of tissues, and organs work together in systems to accomplish major life
            functions. For example, the human digestive system functions through interactions of
            organs that include the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines to process
            food that a person eats.
