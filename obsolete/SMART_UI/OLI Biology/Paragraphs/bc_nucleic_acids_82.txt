Information contained in DNA is used in two ways: it must be transmitted to the next
			generation of cells and used to make proteins. Prior to cell division, all DNA must be
				copied (DNA replication), so that the two daughter cells have
			the same DNA as the original cell. Thus, the information carried in the DNA is precisely
			duplicated to maintain consistency throughout the personâ€™s body and throughout the
			person's life.
