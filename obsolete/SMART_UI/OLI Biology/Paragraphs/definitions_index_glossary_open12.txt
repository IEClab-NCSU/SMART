The attraction of an electronegative atom for a hydrogen that is covalently
                        bonded to another electronegative atom. This involves the attraction of a
                        hydrogen with a partial positive charge to an atom with a partial negative
                        charge. However, only hydrogens covalently bonded to an electronegative atom
                        can participate in hydrogen bonding.  Refer to page.
