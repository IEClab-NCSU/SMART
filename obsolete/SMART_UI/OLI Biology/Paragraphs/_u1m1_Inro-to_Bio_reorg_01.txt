 This biology course is built around several key concepts that provide unifying
			explanations for how and why structures are formed and processes occur in a biological
			system. Because it is not possible to cover the breadth of biology in one semester, an
			understanding of these key concepts will provide a basis for extending your knowledge to
			biology beyond the specific topics covered in this course. One of the major goals of the
			course therefore is for you to learn the fundamentals of the concepts and recognize how
			they can be applied in other contexts.
