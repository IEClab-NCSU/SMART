You should become familiar with the functional groups associated with the sidechain atoms of each amino acid.  You should be able to infer the properties of the side chain from the 2D chemical diagram and the 3D structure.  For  example, which amino acids have polar sidechains? Which have planer aromatic groups?  You can review the basic functional groups that were discussed in the first lecture by following this link.
