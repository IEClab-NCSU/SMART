Any exponential growth model eventually predicts population sizes that are
                    impossibly large. In reality, limiting factors put the brakes on population
                    growth by reducing birth rates and/or increasing death rates. Often these
                    factors become particularly intense when populations are large and crowded. The
                    result is logistic growth, a pattern in which populations rise quickly at first
                    and then level off at carrying capacity. A graph of logistic growth resembles a
                    lazy S-shaped curve.
