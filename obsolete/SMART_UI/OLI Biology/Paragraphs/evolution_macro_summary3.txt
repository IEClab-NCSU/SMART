Biologists assign species to clades based on homologous structures and genes.
            Homologous features are detailed, genetic or genetically-based similarities that are
            best explained as the outcome of shared ancestry. All species share a few basic
            cellular features that were inherited from one or a few early cell types. More
            closely related groups of animal or plant species have similar body structures such
            as the limb bone arrangements seen in modern tetrapod (four-limbed) animals. Through
            careful analysis of many different characteristics, biologists create phylogenetic
            tree diagrams that represent hypotheses about how lifeâ€™s clades have evolved over
            time. DNA sequences are a particularly valuable and rich source of data that help in
            building such trees.
