Somatic cells are all the nonreproductive cells. Somatic cells are
								diploid and reproduce using mitosis. Diploid
						cells (2N) have two copies of each chromosome.
Germ cells are immature reproductive cells. Germ cells are diploid
						and divide using meiosis to produce gametes. Gametes
						are haploid reproductive cells (sperm and eggs). Haploid cells (1N) have one
						copy of each chromosome.
