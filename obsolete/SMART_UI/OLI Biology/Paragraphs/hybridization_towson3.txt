As a general rule, hybridization will take place to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds
          that can be formed between two polynucleotide strands. However, another structural
          limitation is placed on the formation of the hydrogen bonds between two lengths of
          polynucleotide strands: the strands must be anti-parallel to each other. This means that
          the since the backbne has a 5' end and a 3' end, two strands hydridized to each other must
          have one strand oriented 5' to 3' and the complimentary strand 3' to 5' as illustrated
          below.
