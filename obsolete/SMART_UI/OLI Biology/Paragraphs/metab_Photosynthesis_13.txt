Land plants face a different set of challenges. Plant leaves are the main location of
			photosynthesis. They are often large, flat structures that are adapted for maximum light
			absorption. In many plants, leaves also are held high above the ground by tall stems.
			Growing tall is an adaptation that helps a plant get high-intensity sunlight, because
			short plants are more likely to be shaded by taller ones.
