In order for DNA to function effectively at storing information, two key processes are
            required. First, information stored in the DNA molecule must be copied, with minimal
            errors, every time a cell divides. This ensures that both daughter cells inherit the
            complete set of genetic information from the parent cell. Second, the information stored
            in the DNA molecule must be translated, or expressed. In order for the stored
            information to be useful, cells must be able to access the instructions for making
            specific proteins, so the correct proteins are made in the right place at the right
            time.
