Populations change through four primary processes. New members can arise by birth through reproduction of existing population members. In the photo on the
			previous page, a white-tailed deer has given birth to two offspring (family sizes vary
			widely among species). New population members may also immigrate
			(move into the population) from other areas outside the boundaries set by the
			researcher. A population declines through the death of its
			existing members. The population may also decrease if members emigrate (move away to areas outside the boundaries enclosing the population).
			To simplify calculations ecologists often assume that a population is closed - that
			emigration and immigration do not occur. For this course we will adopt this idea and
			assume that, unless otherwise stated, the populations we analyze are closed.
