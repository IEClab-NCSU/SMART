In spite of the fact that all cells share certain characteristics, there is incredible
			diversity in structure and function among different cells. The human body alone contains
			trillions of cells of more than 200 different types, each with a unique structure and
			function. Cells are categorized into two types: Prokaryotes are
			small, simple, single-cell organisms; bacteria are the most prevalent kind.
					Eukaryotes are larger, and most often they are
			multicellular organisms, including plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic cells are
			about 15 times wider than the typical prokaryotic cell, and up to 1,000 times greater in
			volume. The images below show examples of a prokaryote and single-celled eukaryotic
			organisms.
