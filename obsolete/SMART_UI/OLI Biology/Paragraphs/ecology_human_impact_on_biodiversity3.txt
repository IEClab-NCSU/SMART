Genetic diversity is the inherited variation among individuals within a
                        single species or population. It provides the raw material for
                        evolution.
Species richness is the number of different species within a community.
Ecosystem diversity is the variety of distinct ecosystem types (habitats)
                        within a region. In some places a wide array of habitats can form a diverse
                        patchwork of life.
