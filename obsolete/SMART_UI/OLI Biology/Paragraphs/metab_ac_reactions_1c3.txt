Check your understanding of how energy is shuttled from catabolic reactions
						(which release energy) to anabolic reactions (which require energy). Start
						by looking at the diagram below. The big red and yellow arrows are indicating how
						energy flows between the chemical reactions. Cellular respiration is shown
						on top, and protein synthesis is shown on the bottom. See if you can predict
						the labels that match the numbers.
