The exponential growth model assumes that populations will maintain constant rates of
			birth, death, and increase as they grow larger. In reality, we often see that
			populations stop growing—and sometimes even crash—due to the effects of limiting factors. Limiting factors are biotic or abiotic factors that limit populations by reducing birth rates,
			increasing death rates, or both. Limiting factors may also increase rates of emigration
			or decrease immigration.
