Meiosis achieves more than just halving the chromosome number. It also introduces
					variability in the way the genes are distributed in the gametes. In diploid
					cells, there are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. Each pair of homologues has
					the same set of genes, though they can have different alleles (or
					forms) of each gene. One homologue comes from your mother and the other comes
					from your father. You may have inherited an allele for straight hair from your
					mother and an allele for wavy hair from your father. When meiosis takes place,
					the homologous chromosomes will separate, so one gamete will carry the allele
					for wavy hair and the other for straight hair. Each trait on each chromosome
					will segregate its two alleles in a completely random way. There are also other
					additional ways of “shuffling the cards” of genes, which explains why siblings
					from the same parents can be so different.
