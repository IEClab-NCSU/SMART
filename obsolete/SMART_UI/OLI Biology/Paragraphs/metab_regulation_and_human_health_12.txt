In living organisms, metabolic processes are tightly regulated under normal conditions.
			The cell, and the organism as a whole (e.g., the human body), tend to respond to
			external influences in ways that maintain a relatively stable internal environment. This
			ability or tendency is called homeostasis and depends on a complex set of
			stabilizing responses.
