The cell membrane must be a dynamic structure if the cell is to grow and
							respond to environmental changes. To keep the membrane fluid at
							physiological temperatures the cell alters the composition of the
							phospholipids. The right ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids
							keeps the membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life. For
							example winter wheat responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing
							the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes. In animal cells
							cholesterol helps to prevent the packing of fatty acid tails and thus
							lowers the requirement of unsaturated fatty acids. This helps maintain
							the fluid nature of the cell membrane without it becoming too liquid at
							body temperature. The fluidity of the membrane is demonstrated in the
							following animation. The lipids in the membrane are in random bulk flow
							moving about 22 Âµm (micrometers) per second. Phospholipids freely move
							in the same layer of the membrane and rarely flip to the other layer.
							Flipping of phospholipids from one layer to the other rarely occurs
							because flipping requires the hydrophilic head to pass through the
							hydrophobic region of the bilayer.
