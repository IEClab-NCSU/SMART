Ultimately, energy for life comes from the sun. It is captured by plants through
                    the process of photosynthesis (an anabolic process) and is stored in the form of
                    glucose (a sugar). Living organisms can then go through the process of cellular
                    respiration (a catabolic process) to transform the energy stored in the glucose
                    into ATP, which is used to do work in the cell.
