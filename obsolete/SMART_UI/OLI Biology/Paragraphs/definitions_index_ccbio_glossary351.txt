One type of the long fatty acid molecules comprising fats and olis
                                (i.e., triglycerides). Unsaturated fatty acids have one, two, or
                                even three double bonds along the carbon “backbone.” In each double
                                bond, the carbons are bonded to only one hydrogen atom. These fatty
                                acids have less hydrogen; and thus, are “unsaturated” with hydrogen.
                                Unsaturated fats tend to have a lower melting point and will remain
                                fluid at room temperature. They are called oils and are commonly
                                produced by plants; for example olive oil, corn oil, and canola oil.
