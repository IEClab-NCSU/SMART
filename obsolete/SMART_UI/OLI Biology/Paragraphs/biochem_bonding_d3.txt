The water molecule is a very important example of a molecule with hydrogen bonds. It is the
					hydrogen bonding of the water molecules that give water many of its unique and
					life-sustaining properties. The water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms
					covalently bonded to a oxygen atom. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen. This means that oxygen has a greater
					affinity for the electron pair than the hydrogen does. Because the electrons are
					more strongly attracted to the oxygen, the electron pair is unevenly distributed
					between the oxygen and each hydrogen atom . As a result, the oxygen becomes
					slightly negative and each hydrogen atom is slightly positive. A similar
					situation occurs whenever hydrogen is bonded to elements that strongly attract
					electrons. Oxygen and nitrogen are the two such elements that are frequently
					bonded to hydrogen in biological molecules.
