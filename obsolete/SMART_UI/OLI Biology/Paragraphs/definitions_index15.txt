The term “hydrophobic interactions” is used to describe the force driving the 
                        exclusion of nonpolar molecules from aqueous environment.  In contrast to other 
                        non-covalent interactions, there is NO strong attractive force bringing nonpolar 
                        molecules together.  Water molecules have stronger attraction for other water 
                        molecules than for non-polar molecules. As a result, water molecules tend to 
                        bond to each other (via hydrogen bonds) excluding nonpolar molecules.   
                        Non-polar molecules do interact with each other via van der Waals bonds, but 
                        these week interactions cannot be considered the driving force for exclusion of
                        non-polar molecules from water. Deeper understanding of hydrophobic interactions 
                        requires familiarity with concepts of thermodynamics (entropy).
