NADH is oxidized by the electron transport chain by the transfer of the two
          electrons from NADH to complex I. These electrons are then transferred to coenzyme Q,
          followed by transfer to complex III. The electrons are then carried by cytochrome C to
          complex IV, where the electrons are used to reduce oxygen to water. The energy that is
          released by the transfer of electrons from NADH to water is used to transport a total of
          10 protons across the inner membrane. For every pair of electrons, four protons are
          transported by complex I, four by complex II and two by complex IV.
