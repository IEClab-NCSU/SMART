In saturated fatty acids, all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds and
					each carbon is bonded to two or three H atoms; each carbon is “saturated” with
					hydrogen. Because all the bonds are single, the entire fatty acid can adopt a
					linear shape. Unsaturated fatty acids have one, two, or even three double bonds
					along the carbon “backbone.” Notice in the diagram below that at each double
					bond, the carbons involved are bonded to only one instead of two hydrogen atoms.
					Thus these fatty acids have less hydrogen; they are “unsaturated” with respect
					to hydrogen. The double bonds found in the unsaturated fatty acids have an
					effect on the overall shape of a triglyceride: unsaturated fatty acids are
					normally “kinked,” because the double bond prevents free rotation between the
					two carbons involved.
