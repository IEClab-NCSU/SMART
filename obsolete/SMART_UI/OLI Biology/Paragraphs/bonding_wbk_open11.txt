Carbon and nitrogen can also form planer geometries, where all of the atoms that
					are bound to the carbon (or nitrogen) are in the same plane as the carbon or
					nitrogen. In the case of carbon, a planer geometry is usually observed if the
					carbon is involved in a double bond, while the tetrahydral geometry is found if
					the carbon is forming single bonds. Compare the structure of methanol to
					formaldhyde in the Jmol below. In methanol, carbon forms four single bonds while
					in formaldehyde there is a double bond between the carbon and the oxygen. The carbon atom in methanol shows tetrahdyral geometry, while the carbon atom in formaldehdye is planer; the two hydrogens and oxygen lie in the same plane as the carbon..
