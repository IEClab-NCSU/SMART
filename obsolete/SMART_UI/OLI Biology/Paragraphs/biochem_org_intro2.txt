In chemistry, the word “organic” has a special meaning. It is different from the
			grocery-store meaning, where “organic” refers to foods that are grown in a particular
			way and are free of chemical pesticides. In fact, many of the chemical pesticides than
			an organic farmer would never use are themselves organic molecules!
