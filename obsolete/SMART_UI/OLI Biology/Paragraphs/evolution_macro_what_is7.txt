In practice, biologists often use the term “species” to describe a biological lineage.
            The definition of “species” you learned earlier in this Unit fits the idea of a lineage.
            Consider the Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). These birds use
            their sensitive, flat bills to capture small animal prey in shallow water. There are
            populations of Roseate Spoonbill in coastal and wetland areas within South America,
            Central America, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Individual Spoonbills can move from one
            population to another, taking their genes and adaptive traits with them. Changes in the
            genetic makeup of one population can affect the genetic makeup of other populations over
            time, so the species as a whole evolves as a unit. Yet the evolution of the Roseate
            Spoonbill does not affect the genetic makeup of other bird species. Five additional
            species of Spoonbill live in different parts of Africa, Australia, and Eurasia. Each is
            a distinct biological lineage.
