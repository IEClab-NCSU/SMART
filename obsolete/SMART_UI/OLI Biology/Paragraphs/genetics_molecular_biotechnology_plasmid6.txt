These are short DNA sequences that are recognized by restriction endonucleases, in
                the case of this plasmid they are the EcoR1 and BamH1 sites. Restriction
                endonucleases cut the DNA at these sequences, allowing the insertion of the
                synthetic gene between the sites. The actual mechanism is discussed in the next
                section.
