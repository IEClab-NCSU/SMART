Glycolysis of glucose produces 2 pyruvates, so the citric acid cycle happens
					twice. Therefore, per glucose, the citric acid cycle produces 2 ATP, 3 NADH, and
					2 FADH2. So far, we have produced a total of 4 ATP (that's not very
					much). In the next step, we are about to produce over 30 ATP molecules. That's a
					lot more!
