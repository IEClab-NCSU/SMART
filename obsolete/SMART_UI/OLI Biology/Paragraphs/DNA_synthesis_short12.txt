To accomplish this mending of the DNA, a separate DNA polymerase binds to the ‘nick’ left
          in the DNA between the 3’ end of the newly synthesized DNA and the 5’ end of the RNA
          primer. The substrate requirements for DNA polymerase are met even though there is no
          apparent single stranded DNA present. The DNA polymerase removes the RNA primer and a few
          nucleotides of DNA in front of it while simultaneously synthesizing DNA on the 3’ end of
          the existing DNA. This process is referred to as nick translation.
