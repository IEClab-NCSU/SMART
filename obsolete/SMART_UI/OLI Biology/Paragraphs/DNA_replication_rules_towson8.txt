DNA polymerases are members of a very interesting family of enzymes because of the multi
          functional nature of their activity. As has been discussed previously, they are capable of
          synthesizing DNA given the appropriate substrate. They have their own activity to remove
          RNA and/or DNA in front of the synthesis as described on the lagging strand of the
          replication fork. Equally important to the organism is the ability to edit errors during
          synthesis by either preventing the incorporation of the incorrect base and/or by removing
          an incorrectly incorporated base before the next base is added. These editing functions
          can reduce the error frequency by 2 orders of magnitude.
