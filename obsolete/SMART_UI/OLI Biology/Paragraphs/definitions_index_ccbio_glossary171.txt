Substances that dissolve in or are attracted to water. Hydrophilic
                                    (from Greek meaning "water-loving")
                                refers to molecules that are water soluble. Hydrophilic molecules
                                contain polar functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds or
                                ionic bonds with water. Ionic and polar substances are
                                hydrophilic.
