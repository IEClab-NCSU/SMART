A large and complex molecule formed by combining smaller subunits
                                producing a larger unit consisting of many atoms with new
                                properties. Biological macromolecules are special large
                                macromolecules produced by living organisms that contain carbon
                                atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen atoms. There are four main types
                                of biological macromolecules (sometimes referred to as
                                    biomolecules or biomacromolecules)
                                that you will be learning about in this course: carbohydrates,
                                nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins.
