In this unit, you will focus on the direct links between genetic information and visible
            traits. This will help you to learn how genetic information can be passed from one
            generation to the next and how these genes affect the later generation. We will
            introduce simple examples of traits that are clearly visible and have a direct
            correlation to genetics.
