For synthesis to proceed, the enzyme imposes a third restriction on the substrate. Not
            only does it require a DNA template and a primer, but the primer must have a free,
              3â€™ hydroxyl group for the addition of the next deoxy-nucleotide. 
And finally, all four deoxy-nucleotide triphosphates must be present to completely
            synthesis the complementary strand of DNA. For DNA synthesis (replication) this means
            dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP must be present. Collectively these are referred to as dNTPs
              (deoxy-Nucleotide TriPhosphates).
