 An important aspect of carbon bonding is the fact that
					carbon can covalently bond to four groups and that the bonding geometry of the
					carbon atom is tetrahedral. Therefore, if the four groups attached to the carbon
					are different, then two unique arrangements of the groups around the carbon atom
					are possible and this carbon is said to be an asymmetric center or a
						chiral center. The two arrangements of groups about the carbon are
					mirror images of each other and these two structures are referred to as
						enantiomers. It is impossible to superimpose these two mirror
					images, consequently they are distinct molecules.
