The process of DNA replication requires that the original DNA act as a template
          for the newly formed DNA. How the new DNA acts as a template could occur in multiple ways.
          As depicted below the double stranded DNA (anti-parallel strands indicated by the grey and
          opposite polarity blue strand) could be completely copied leaving the original strands of
          DNA intact (grey) and yielding a newly synthesized double strand DNA containing two new
          strands (blue). This is referred to as conservative replication. The second model of DNA
          replication starts with the same double stranded DNA but the products each contain one of
          the original strands and a complementary newly synthesized strand. This is referred to as
            semi-conservative replication. Biological organisms have been shown to
          replicate their DNA by semi-conservative synthesis.
