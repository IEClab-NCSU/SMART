The cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, is
					the boundary of the cell; it determines what enters and exits the cell, and it
					is how the cell interacts with its environment. Have you ever looked closely at
					the colors swirling in a soap bubble? This may give you a feel for the fluid
					nature of a cell's membrane. A membrane's components are in constant motion, as
					if they were flowing in a river. A variety of different proteins,
						carbohydrates, sterols, and other molecules
					are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. This gives the impression
					of a tile mosaic, which has variously shaped and colored tiles embedded in
					grout. Because of its fluidity and its variety, biologists currently describe
					the cell membrane as a fluid mosaic.
