Carbohydrates are organic molecules that
					consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in a 1:2:1 ratio. The
					most abundant class of macromolecules found in
					living systems, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy in living
					systems. Large complex carbohydrates can be used to store energy. For example, a
					potato is full of starch, which is a complex carbohydrate that the potato plant
					uses to store energy. When you eat the complex carbohydrate, your body breaks
					the large molecules into their smaller subunits (sugars), which you
					will then use to fuel your own bodyâ€™s energy needs.
