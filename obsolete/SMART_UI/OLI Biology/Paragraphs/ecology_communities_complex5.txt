Indirect interactions can produce surprises in communities. Some species, called keystone species, may be very influential in communities even
			though they are not particularly abundant or large. In architecture, a keystone is a
			single wedge-shaped stone at the top of a stone arch that maintains the integrity of the
			structure; its removal will cause both sides of the arch to collapse. A keystone
			species, then is a species that has an unexpectedly strong effect on community stability
			or diversity. Keystone species play unique roles and are not easily replaced by other
			species within the community. We often discover their importance only after they are
			eliminated by human actions.
