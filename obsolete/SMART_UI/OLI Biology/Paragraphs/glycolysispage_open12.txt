 Under anaerobic (oxygen limited) conditions, which occurs in the muscle tissue during
          vigorous activity, the NADH produced in glycolysis cannot be reoxidized to NAD+
          by electron transport because there is insufficient oxygen to accept electrons. Under
          these conditions, the cell runs out of NAD+ and glycolysis will halt and the
          cell can no longer produce ATP.
