Although we will not delve into the specifics of this topic, carbohydrates play a variety of
					roles in identification and signaling. One of the ways your immune system is
					able to identify foreign invaders is through detection of the different
					carbohydrates displayed on the surface of cells. Additionally, the first step in
					fertilization between a sperm and egg is generally believed to involve
					carbohydrate-to-carbohydrate interactions. As a final example, the specific
					carbohydrates attached to the surface of your red blood cells determine your
					“blood group” (A,B,O) and predict what kind of blood you can safely receive in a
					transfusion.
