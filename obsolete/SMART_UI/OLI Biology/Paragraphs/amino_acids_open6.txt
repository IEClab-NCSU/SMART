 If all of the amino acids have the same basic structure with an amino, a
					carboxyl and a hydrogen fixed to the –carbon, then the large variation in
					the properties and structure of the amino acids must come from the fourth group
					attached to the –carbon. This group is referred to as the side chain
					of the amino acid or the R group. The structures of the 20 common amino acids are shown below.  Clicking on the amino acid in the table, displays three-dimensional model of that amino acid below the table.
