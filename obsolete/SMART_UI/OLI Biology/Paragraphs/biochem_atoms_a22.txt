All living and nonliving things are composed of matter. Matter can
					be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass. The mass of an object
					is a measure of how much matter it has (that is, how much “stuff” is in it).
					Mass is not exactly the same as weight, but here on Earth we can measure and
					compare the masses of different objects by weighing them.
