Most agreed that something should be done, but how should the
			deer population be controlled? It would be unsafe to allow the public to hunt in the
			park. Some citizens argued that birth control injections should be used to manage the
			population, but evidence indicated that this would be expensive and ineffective. After
			extensive deliberation and community input, a deer control program was begun. In the
			winters of 2010 and 2011, sharpshooters were contracted to kill deer at the park; meat
			was provided to an area food bank. Sharpshooters removed 600 deer in 2010 and 377 deer
			in 2011. As a result, the deer population fell from 1,277 in 2009 to 374 in the spring
			of 2012. Initial data indicate that many tree, shrub, and wildflower species are already
			beginning to recover as a result.
