The stability of double stranded DNA is due to two factors, hydrogen bonds and base
          stacking. Hydrogen bonds provide an attractive force between the strands while base
          stacking (van der Waals) stabilizes the helical structure. The Jmol below shows the
          stacking of the bases and illustrates the hydrogen bonding pattern for a GC basepair. The
          stability of the DNA is to some extent determined by the number of hydrogen bonds holding
          the two strands together. Thus DNA with more GC base pairs is likely to be more stable
          than one with more AT base pairs.
