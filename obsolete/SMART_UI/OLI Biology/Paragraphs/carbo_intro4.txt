 The primary function of carbohydrates is as a source of energy. You will recall that molecules
			are a collection of atoms connected by covalent bonds. In general, single covalent bonds
			can be represented as having approximately 100 Kcal/mole of energy associated with the
			force that holds the two atoms together. The most common carbohydrate in nature is glucose, which has the general formula (C(H2O))6 or C6H12O6.  When glucose is completely metabolized in a cell, 673 kcal of energy is released for each mole of glucose.  The net equation for this process of glucose oxidation can be written as follows:
					(C(H2O))6 + 6 O2
				-------------> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 673 kcal
				(energy)
