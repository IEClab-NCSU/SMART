Researchers studying populations usually describe birth and death in terms of rates so
			that they can compare different populations to each other on a similar basis. According
			to Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report statistics, in 2010 there were
			roughly 530 cases of murder in New York City and about 180 murder cases in New Orleans,
			Louisiana. Think New York City is more dangerous? Raw numbers don’t tell the full story.
			In 2010, New York City had a population of over 8 million people compared to New
			Orleans’ population of about 350,000. Therefore the rate of
			murder was almost 8 times greater in New Orleans than in NYC.
