As with proteins, the bases in the nucleic acid can interact with each other to form complex structures.  The most important type of interaction between the bases is hydrogen bonding.  If bases on two strands have complimentary hydrogen bonding properties  they can form a basepair.  Double stranded DNA consists of two anti-parallel hydrogen bonded strands.  RNA can also exist as an anti-parallel two stranded structure or it can assume more complicated structures, such as the tRNA molecule shown on the previous page.  The detailed chemical structure of DNA and RNA will be explored in more detail in the following pages.
