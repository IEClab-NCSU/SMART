Because T and U are identical in the hydrogen bonding that each makes with A, this means that a backbone (strand) of DNA can hydrogen bond with another strand of DNA but also with a strand of RNA. The ability of the strands of DNA and RNA to hydrogen bond with each other either as homodimers (DNA-DNA, RNA-RNA) or as heterodimers (DNA-RNA) is referred to as hybridization.
