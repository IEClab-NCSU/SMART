Lifeâ€™s universal energy carrier is adenosine
							triphosphate (ATP). ATP acts as a shuttle that
					transfers energy from catabolic reactions that release energy from complex
					molecules (such as cellular respiration) to the anabolic reactions that consume
					energy (such as protein synthesis). The energy released from catabolic reactions
					can be stored for later use through the formation of ATP by combining ADP plus a
					phosphate group. Then, when energy is required for anabolic reactions, ATP can
					be broken down into ADP and a phosphate group, releasing energy that was stored
					in the phosphate bond.
