Water is an input to photosynthesis and a waste product of aerobic respiration, so it is biotically cycled.  These flows are relatively small.  Solar energy powers the major processes driving Earthâ€™s water cycle.  Water evaporates, condenses in the air, returns to Earth as precipitation, and is transported through wind, river flow, and ocean currents.  Land plants play an important role in the water cycle.  They take up water through their roots and release it as vapor through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata.  This process, called transpiration, greatly accelerates the transfer of water from soil to the atmosphere.  A forest can increase humidity and even boost rainfall in a region through this process.
