Digestible carbohydrates provide energy in a form that is easily accessible.
					Glucose, with the chemical formula C6H12O6, is
					a simple sugar and a monosaccharide. It is one of the most abundant and
					important energy molecules for living things. The energy stored in covalent
					bonds between atoms (within a glucose molecule, in this case) is released during
					cellular respiration, when glucose is broken down and converted to simpler, more
					stable molecules. This energy can be captured to make ATP, which can then be
					used to power cellular processes. This will be covered in greater detail in the
					metabolism unit.
