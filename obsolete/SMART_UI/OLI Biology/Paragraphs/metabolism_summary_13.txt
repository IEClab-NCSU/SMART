The central anabolic pathway enabling most life on Earth is photosynthesis. Photosynthetic organisms (plants, algae, and cyanobacteria)
			use light energy to build sugar molecules from carbon dioxide and water. In this way,
			they effectively convert light energy from the sun into the chemical bond energy of
			sugar molecules. Sugar is a good medium-term energy storage molecule, but is not
			directly useful for doing work in cells.
