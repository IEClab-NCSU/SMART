 The log conversion reduces a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration to a one-unit
					change in pH. Thus, starting at pH 7, a solution at pH 6 would have 10 times
					more H+ than a neutral solution. On the other hand, a solution at pH
					8 would have 10 times fewer H+ than the solution with pH 7. If you
					skip a few units, the differences between solutions become very great indeed. Lemon juice (pH 2) has one million times more
						H+ ions per unit volume than seawater, which has a pH of about 8.
