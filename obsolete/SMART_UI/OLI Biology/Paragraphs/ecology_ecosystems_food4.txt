In addition to the chains of consumers that eat living prey, many consumers feed on dead
			organic material. Dead plants, dead animals, shed parts of animals such as fur or skin,
			shed parts of plants such as leaves, and feces all contain nutrients and calories.
			Animals that feed on dead organic matter are called detritivores; some of them
			specialize on eating dead animals (e.g., vultures) and others feed on dead plant
			material (e.g., earthworms, which consume decaying leaves). Bacteria and fungi that
			colonize dead material and absorb food molecules from it are called
			decomposers. Detritivores and decomposers extract remaining calories and
			nutrients found in dead organisms and dung. In the process, they release simple
			inorganic wastes to the environment, making chemical elements available to
			producers.
