Selective breeding is not as simple as it may appear. Let’s say you take a dairy
					cow who is a high milk producer. You mate her with a male who has the red
					spotted coat you like. Unfortunately, you are not guaranteed to get a female
					calf who is a high milk producer and has red spots. You are not just dealing
					with the two traits you desire in a dairy cow (high milk yield and red spots),
					but every trait (i.e. every allele) that each parent cow
					has. When you breed these two animals, the offspring will have some combination
					of all of the parents’ traits. Because of this, it often
					takes many generations of artificial selection to consistently produce offspring
					with the desired traits.
