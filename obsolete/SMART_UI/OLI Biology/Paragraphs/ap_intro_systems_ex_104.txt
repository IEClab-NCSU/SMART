 Bones are found throughout the body from the skull in the head to the 26 bones
                    in the foot. Bones allow us to maintain our stature, they protect softer
                    internal organs, and they let us move around. Bones are interconnected by
                    articulations, another word for joints. In an articulation, where bone meets
                    bone, there is a layer of softer cartilage. Articulations are then stabilized by
                    ligaments, which help keep the bones aligned properly. Bones are connected to
                    the muscular system by tendons, which allow the body to move.
