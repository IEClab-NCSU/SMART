It is the process through which a complementary copy of
                                protein-coding mRNA is synthesized, using one strand of DNA as a
                                template. The new RNA strand is identical to the complement of the
                                single strand of DNA from which it was transcribed except that the
                                base thymine (T) in the DNA strand is replaced by the base uracil
                                (U) in the RNA strand.
