Many bacterial genes are expressed at the same time as part of an operon. The expression
            of the genes in the operon is controlled by a repressor protein. The repressor protein
            will bind to the regulatory region at a DNA sequence. This sequence is the
                operator. When the repressor is bound to the DNA, RNA polymerase cannot
            transcribe the structural genes because it is blocked by the repressor protein bound on
            the DNA; under these conditions, none of the enzymes required for the pathway is
            produced. Whether or not the repressor binds to the operator is controlled by the
            binding of a small molecule to the repressor. The small molecule is either the compound
            that enters the pathway (for catabolic, or degradative pathways) or the compound that is
            produced by the pathway (for anabolic, or synthetic pathways). The compound binds to the
            repressor protein and causes the repressor either to bind to the DNA (this is called
            positive control), turning off transcription, or to be released from the operator site
            on the DNA (this is called negative control), turning on transcription. You will explore
            both of these control mechanisms in the spotlight below.
