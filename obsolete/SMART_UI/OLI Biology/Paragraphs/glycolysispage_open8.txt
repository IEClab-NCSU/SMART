 The levels of glucose in the blood vary considerably at times. We will discuss how
          glucose levels are regulated in the section on integrated metabolism. The focus here is to
          understand how the entry of glucose into the cell is spontaneous, even when the levels of
          glucose in the blood can drop to low values. How is it possible to maintain a negative
          Gibbs free energy for glucose transport into the cell, even if there are low levels of
          glucose outside the cell?
