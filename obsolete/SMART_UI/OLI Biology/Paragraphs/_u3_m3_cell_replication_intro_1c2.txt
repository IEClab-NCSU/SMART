Somatic cells produced through mitosis are diploid. “Di-” means “two,” and
			diploid cells contain two copies of every chromosome. Chromosomes are the condensed form of
				chromatin,
			the combination of DNA and proteins that fill the eukaryotic nucleus. Humans have a
			total of 46 chromosomes in their diploid cells. One way to write this is "2n =
				46." Humans who have more or less than 46 chromosomes sometimes survive, but
			usually have life-altering conditions, such as Down syndrome. Down syndrome is caused by
			having three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies.
