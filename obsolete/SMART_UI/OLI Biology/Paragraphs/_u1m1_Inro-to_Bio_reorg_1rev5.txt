After completing a module, you will have a chance to demonstrate what you learned by taking a
			graded quiz. The module quizzes will assess and reinforce your learning as you progress
			through the unit. When you complete all the modules in a unit, you can participate in a
				“My Response” activity, where you will assess your own
			understanding of the unit content. After reflecting on your ability to achieve the
			learning objectives, you will have a chance to submit questions to your instructor, and
			then you will conclude your activities with a unit quiz.
