All cells have a cell membrane that defines the boundary between the
			cellâ€™s interior and the external environment. The membrane mediates communication to the
			external environment. The cell membrane has a unique chemical structure that enables the
			passage of particles into and out of the cell. Some particles are able to simply diffuse
			across the membrane. In other situations, special proteins are
			required to help facilitate the movement. When particles move against a concentration
			gradient, energy is required. In the Metabolism unit, you'll explore energy and
			learn about out how cells generate and use this energy.
