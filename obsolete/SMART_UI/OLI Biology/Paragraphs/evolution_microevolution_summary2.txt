Several mechanisms can lead to evolution. The first and most well known is
                    natural selection. Natural selection is at work when certain genetic types in a
                    population survive or grow better than others in a given environment. The
                    environment influences the make-up of the gene pool in natural selection, and
                    the result is often quite predictable. Sexual selection occurs when individuals
                    with certain traits are more likely to obtain mates than other individuals.
                    Sexual selection often leads to the development of extravagant traits in males
                    like the tail feather of peacocks or the elaborate mating flights of
                    hummingbirds. Sexual selection can also entail fighting among males for access
                    to females. This is a powerful force in nature. In contrast to natural and
                    sexual selection, artificial selection involves the direct manipulation of a
                    populationâ€™s gene pool through human interference. Humans select individuals who
                    have desired traits for breeding in an effort to enhance and purify those traits
                    within offspring. This technique has been employed for thousands of years and
                    has led to the domestication of crop plants, livestock, ornamental plants, and
                    pets. The great number of varieties you see in these plants and animals is the
                    result of artificial selection.
