Sea level rise. The average sea level has increased by an
                    estimated 0.2 m since 1900, both because the ocean water is expanding as it
                    warms and because glaciers on land are melting. Sea level rise is expected to
                    continue and accelerate with continued warming of the climate. Particularly when
                    coupled with more intense storms, increasing sea levels threaten human
                    settlements and natural ecosystems in low-lying coastal areas worldwide.
