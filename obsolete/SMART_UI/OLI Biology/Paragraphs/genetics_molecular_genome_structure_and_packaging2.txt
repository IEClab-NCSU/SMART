The prokaryotic genome resides on a circular piece of double-stranded DNA; there is no
            membrane to separate DNA from the rest of the cell. Most bacterial genomes are several
            million nucleotides long. The E. coli genome, for example, is
            approximately 5 million nucleotides long. Although this is a relatively small genome,
            the physical length of the DNA is longer than the length of the bacterial cell. In order
            to condense the DNA into a smaller size, the DNA is supercoiled. In supercoiled DNA, the
            double helix of the DNA contains additional turns beyond the normal one turn per 10 base
            pairs. These additional twists introduce strain into the DNA that is relieved by
            large-scale twists in the entire DNA molecule, or supercoils. A good model for
            supercoiling is an old-fashioned spiral phone cord. If you form the cord into a circle,
            and then rotate or twist one of the free ends relative to the other, you will introduce
            supercoils into the cord.
