 Methane is a small molecule composed of 5 atoms. Other molecules,
                                such as polysaccharides or proteins, may be humongous containing
                                thousands of atoms bonded together. Other characteristics of a
                                molecule are the structure (three dimensional shape), chemical
                                reactivitiy, and solvency.
