Karyotypes can be used to identify chromosomal abnormalities in cells or in developing
            fetuses. Amniocentesis is a medical procedure used to sample fetal cells from a pregnant
            mother. These cells, which are rapidly dividing, can be used to create a karyotype of
            the fetus. This karyotype can then help identify potential chromosomal abnormalities in
            the developing child. Abnormalities could include extra chromosomes, missing
            chromosomes, and even extra or missing pieces of chromosomes.
