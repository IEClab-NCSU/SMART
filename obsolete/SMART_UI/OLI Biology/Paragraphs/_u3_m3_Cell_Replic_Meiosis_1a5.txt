In sexual
				reproduction, two reproductive cells called gametes fuse in the process of
				fertilization. In order to avoid the duplication of the chromosome
			number, gametes are formed through a special form of cell division,
			meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. Cells with a single set of
			chromosomes are haploid (n), in contrast to the somatic (body) cells, which
			are diploid (2n). The fusion of the gametes during fertilization restores
			the diploid chromosome number in the first cell of the new individual, the
				zygote.
