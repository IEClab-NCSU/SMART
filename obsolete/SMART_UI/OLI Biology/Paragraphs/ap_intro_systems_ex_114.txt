The muscular system contains muscle tissues and interconnects with both the
                    nervous system and skeletal system. Nerves control the muscles and allow us to
                    consciously direct movements. Some muscles, such as the muscles that control the
                    pupil of your eye, cannot be controlled consciously but react to nerve stimuli.
                    The skeletal system provides a stiff support for muscles to pull on. Muscles
                    generate force to lift as well as to balance us. The energy produced by
                    contracting muscles (such as when shivering) in the muscle system helps keep us
                    warm. There are many muscle fiber types throughout the body that vary based on
                    function. Parallel muscles form along the long bones, pennate and convergent
                    muscle fibers attach to tendons and circular muscles assist with closing our
                    eyes or puckering our lips.
