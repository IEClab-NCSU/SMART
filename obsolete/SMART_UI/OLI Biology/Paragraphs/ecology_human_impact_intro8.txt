Renewable resources can be used in a sustainable way so long as the rate of use
            does not exceed the rate of renewal. Nonrenewable resources cannot be used
            indefinitely and technologies that rely heavily on them are unsustainable. In
            the table below we summarize several examples of renewable and nonrenewable
            resources.
