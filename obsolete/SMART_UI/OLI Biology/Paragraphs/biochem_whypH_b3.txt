A higher-stakes example of loss of pH regulation occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis. In people
				with diabetes, cells cannot take up glucose (sugar) from the blood efficiently. As a
				result, cells switch from using glucose (sugar) as a fuel source and use fatty acids
				(fats) instead. When fatty acids are broken down, ketone acids are produced as a
				by-product. In healthy individuals, a small amount of ketone acids are released by
				normal metabolic processes; for example, if you are losing weight, fat breakdown
				will add some ketone acids to your bloodstream. This poses no problem because your
				blood is buffered, and your liver and kidneys are able to remove the excess acids
				before they cause problems. However, in people with diabetes, chronic release of
				ketone acids can overwhelm these systems. Ketone acids build up in the blood and
				urine, leading to a condition called ketoacidosis. The presence of excess ketone
				acids lowers the bodyâ€™s pH, leading to several health problems as detailed on the
				figure below. If the pH balance is not restored, diabetics in ketoacidosis can face
				serious harm and even death. Treatment consists of restoring proper insulin levels
				in the body (so that carbohydrates can be absorbed by cells and used as a fuel
				source) and ensuring proper hydration (to help the kidneys flush out the excess
				ketones).
