In the process of cellular respiration, energy that is
			stored in the food that we eat is converted to the bodyâ€™s energy module, ATP. During the
			cellular respiration reaction, food (organic molecules consisting of
			carbohydrates (e.g., glucose), fats, and proteins) is broken down to carbon dioxide (CO2)
			and water (H2O); in the process, ATP is released. This catabolic reaction is expressed as
			follows:
