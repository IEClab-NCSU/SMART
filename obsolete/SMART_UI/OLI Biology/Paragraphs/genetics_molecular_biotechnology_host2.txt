The cells containing the plasmid would be grown in culture media to a high
                    density of cells to produce a high yield of huGH. Lactose would be added to the
                    culture to cause the lac repressor to come off the DNA. This allows RNA
                    polymerase to begin transcription of the growth hormone gene on the plasmid. The
                    mRNA would be translated on the bacterial ribosomes, producing human growth
                    hormone.
