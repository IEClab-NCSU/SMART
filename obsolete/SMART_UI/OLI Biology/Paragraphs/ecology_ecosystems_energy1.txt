We have seen how food chains, trophic levels, and food webs can be used to describe how energy and materials move through an ecosystem.  Although they are not as realistic as food webs, food chains and trophic levels do provide us with some important insights.  They help us understand, for example, why top predators are rare and why meat costs more than grain.
