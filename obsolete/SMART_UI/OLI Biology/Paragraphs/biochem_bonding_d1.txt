Throughout this biology course, you will be studying about many different molecules. Some of
			these molecules exhibit a unique attraction between them, which is referred to as a
			hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonding occurs in molecules in which a nitrogen or oxygen atom
			is bonded to a hydrogen atom. In this situation, the nitrogen or oxygen atom of one
			molecule is attracted to the hydrogen atom in a neighboring molecule. Hydrogen bonding
			has a significant effect on the properties of molecules. For example, the structure of
			the DNA molecule is in part held together by hydrogen bonds.
