The table below contains the functional groups organized based on properties and is
				rich with information and examples about each of the groups. The functional groups
				are listed. You can click on each group to see the chemical properties, as well as
				several examples of molecules, associated with that group. The 3-D structure viewer
				is interactive; click and drag the structure to rotate it. You can also use radio
				buttons to select groups of molecules to explore how the groups are related
				functionally.
