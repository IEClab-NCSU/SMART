Regulation by Hormonal Control. The compound fructose -2,6 bisphosphate (F26P) is an allosteric activator of PFK.  F26P also inhibits  fructose bisphosphatase, the key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis.  The levels of F26P are controlled by hormones via protein phosphorylation levels.  When protein phosphorylation levels are high, F26P is degraded, when phosphorylation levels are low, F26P is synthesized.
