When only DNA is present, the DNA polymerase releases from the DNA leaving a nick in the
          DNA between two DNA segments. DNA polymerase does not have a function to join the two ends
          of the DNA together and thus a separate enzyme, DNA Ligase, recognizes the nick
          in the DNA and links the 3’ end of the one segment to the 5’ end of the next segment.
