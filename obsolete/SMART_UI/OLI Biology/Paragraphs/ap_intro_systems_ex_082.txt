Maintenance of a consistent physical structure is important for the body to function efficiently. Support and 
            structure are among the primary functions of the 
integumentary

 system, the 
skeletal

, system
            and the 
muscular 

 system. These organ systems also allow the body to move in response to internal and external 
            stimuli.
