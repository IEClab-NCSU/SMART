Genetic drift refers to random events that change the frequency of
			alleles and genotypes in a population. It is similar to selection in some ways. Recall
			that in selection, certain genetic types become more frequent in the population because
			they survive well, grow well, mate successfully, or even just because humans like them
			and choose to breed them. In genetic drift, certain genetic types become more frequent
			through dumb luck.
