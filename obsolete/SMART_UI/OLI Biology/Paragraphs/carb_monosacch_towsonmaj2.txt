 In the case of the structure on the left, the number 1 carbon (the top carbon) contains
			the carbonyl that is flanked by a hydrogen and a carbon thus making this an aldehyde.
			This category of carbohydrates is, thus, referred to as  aldoses. In contrast, the
			structure on the right has its carbonyl at the number 2 carbon (the center carbon) and
			this carbonyl is flanked by carbons on both sides, thus, making this carbonyl a ketone.
			Carbohydrates containing this ketone group are referred to as ketoses.
