A chemical change in which new molecules are formed from existing
                                molecules. A chemical reaction (i.e., a transformation) may break up
                                a large molecule resulting into two or more smaller molecules; or,
                                the reaction may combine molecules forming a new substance. Examples
                                of chemical reactions you may recognize are: rust forming through
                                the reaction of oxygen in the air with iron; or, silver tarnish
                                resulting from the reaction of silver with moisture in the air.
