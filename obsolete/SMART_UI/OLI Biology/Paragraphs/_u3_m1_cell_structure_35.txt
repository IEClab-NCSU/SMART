The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a series of sacs and tubes, is the assembly line for
			synthesis of proteins and other cellular components. In eukaryotes, ribosomes are
			associated with the ER, forming the rough ER due to its beaded appearance. The smooth ER
			(without ribosomes) can have different functions depending on the cell type, but it is
			often the site for synthesis of lipids. The Golgi apparatus is the packaging and
			shipping center of the cell, where structural components are delivered to different
			parts of cells.
