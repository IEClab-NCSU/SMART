Heritable changes in DNA packaging do not involve any changes in DNA sequence.
                    This type of inheritance is epigenetic (from the Greek
                    epi-, meaning over, above, or outside). You will recall from the previous page
                    that compact packaging of DNA leads to gene silencing (transcriptionally
                    inactive genes). Compact packaging of DNA requires modifications to DNA itself
                    and to histones, which are DNA-binding proteins involved in packaging. DNA
                    modification involves the addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to
                    specific bases on DNA (cytosine methylation), but does not change the sequence
                    of DNA bases. The methylation pattern can be preserved during DNA replication,
                    so the daughter cells will have the same methylation pattern as the parent cell.
                    In germ cells, the pattern of DNA methylation can be passed through the gametes
                    to the next generation of offspring.
