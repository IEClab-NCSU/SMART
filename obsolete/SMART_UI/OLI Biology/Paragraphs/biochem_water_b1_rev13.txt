The carboxylate group (COOH) on the left interacts strongly with water, while the
					remaining part of the molecule is very hydrophobic and is forced away from
					water. Fatty acids form structures in solution called
						micelles. These spherical structures have the
							hydrophilic part exposed to water on the surface
					of the sphere and bury the hydrophobic part in the center
					of the sphere.
