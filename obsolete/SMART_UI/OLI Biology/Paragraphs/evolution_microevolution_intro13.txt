As you can see from the Fox population example, evolution is not determined by the
			increase or decrease in the number of individuals within a population. Both populations
			saw an increase in the total number of foxes from 1962 to 2202. Microevolution occurs
			when there are changes in the genetic makeup of the population: when the frequency
			(percentage) of each genotype changes over time.
