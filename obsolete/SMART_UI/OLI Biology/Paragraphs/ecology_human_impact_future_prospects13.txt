Unfortunately, there is a limit to what we can reasonably expect to achieve with
                    mitigation. Some degree of climate warming has already occurred. Experts agree
                    that even with our best efforts to mitigate growth in greenhouse gas emissions,
                    these gases will continue to build up in the atmosphere and will continue to
                    modify climate for many decades.
