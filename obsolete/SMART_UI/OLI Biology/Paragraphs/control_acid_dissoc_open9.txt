The buffering of pH plays an important role in the normal function of the
							cell. If the pH drops too low, or becomes too high, the cell can no
							longer function. The principal buffer that is used in biological systems
							is the carbonic acid, a weak acid with an effective pKa of
							6.4, ideally suited to act as a buffer when the pH ~ 7.0
