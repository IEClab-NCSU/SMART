Cellular respiration is a complex, multistep process. Dozens of different enzymes
					and intermediates are involved. Initial steps are accomplished in the cytoplasm,
					and additional steps occur in the mitochondria. At various points along the way,
					intermediates may be removed and used to synthesize fats and other molecules.
					Similarly, different types of food molecules may “feed in” to cell respiration
					at specific junctions in the process.
