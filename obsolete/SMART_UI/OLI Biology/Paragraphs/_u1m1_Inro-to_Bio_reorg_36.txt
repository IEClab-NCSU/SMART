When macromolecules are used as building blocks to form a membrane-bound space,
					you have a cell, which is the fundamental unit of life.
					A cell is essentially a tiny droplet of water and other molecules enclosed by a
					fluid “skin” or membrane. The cell is the smallest and simplest entity that
					possesses all the characteristics of life: it takes in energy and matter to
					grow, producing its own unique macromolecules. It senses and responds to changes
					in the environment. And it reproduces itself with the help of DNA, a
					macromolecule that stores information that helps to guide the cell’s growth.
					There are two main types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The cells of
					prokaryotes are relatively small and simple; they do not have any clearly
					defined compartments inside of them. The cells of eukaryotes, by contrast,
					include membrane-bound organelles: compartments inside
					the cell that contain specific groups of macromolecules and carry out specific
					cellular functions.
