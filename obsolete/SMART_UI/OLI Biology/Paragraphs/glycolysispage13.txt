The levels of NAD+ can be restored by using pyruvate as the electron acceptor.
          In mammals, lactate is the product of this reaction. In yeast, it is alcohol and the
          process of anaerobic glycolysis is referred to as fermentation. The reduction of
          pyruvate will oxidize NADH to NAD+, allowing glycolysis to resume.
