Mitosis is the process by which eukaryotic cells divide into two identical
					daughter cells. The process ensures identical DNA is present in both daughter
					cells. Organisms use mitosis to grow and replace old or malfunctioning cells.
					There are checkpoints during the cell cycle that regulate whether or not a cell
					goes through mitosis. When this regulation goes awry, cells can begin to divide
					uncontrollably, possibly resulting in cancerous tumors.
