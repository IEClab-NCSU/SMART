Waxes are nonpolar lipids that form protective layers on plants and
			animals. For example, waxes cover the feathers of some aquatic birds to keep the
			feathers dry. Plants, on the other hand, often have leaves coated with waxes to prevent
			water from evaporating off the plant surface. Because of their hydrophobic nature, waxes
			prevent water from sticking on the surface of these structures.
