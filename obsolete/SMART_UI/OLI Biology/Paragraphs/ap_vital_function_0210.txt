Single-celled organisms can absorb nutrients and oxygen directly from the
                    environment into the cells, where they are used to support basic cell functions.
                    Waste products are excreted from these single cells in a similar fashion. In
                    multi-celled organisms like humans, however, most cells are not exposed directly
                    to the outside environment. Instead, body cells rely on organ systems to
                    transport and regulate the composition of internal fluids throughout the body.
                    Three main body systems, the 
cardiovascular


system, the 
lymphatic


system, and the urinary system take care of this vital bodily
                    function. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems also participate in the
                    function of immunity, to help defend the body's cells from foreign
                    organisms that may enter the body tissues or fluids. The lymphatic system
                    returns interstitial fluid to blood and the urinary system filters blood to
                    regulate body fluid homeostasis, including volume, pressure, and chemical
                    composition.
