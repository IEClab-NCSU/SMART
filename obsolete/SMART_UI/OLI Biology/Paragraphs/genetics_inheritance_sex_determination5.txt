In 1910, an American geneticist named Thomas Hunt Morgan made an observation that began
            to shed some light on this question. One morning, when peering through a hand lens at a
            male fruit fly, he noticed that it didnâ€™t look right. Instead of having the normally
            brilliant red eyes of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster, this fly had white eyes. Morgan
            was particularly interested in how traits were inherited and distributed in developing
            organisms, and he wondered what caused this fly's eyes to deviate from the norm.
