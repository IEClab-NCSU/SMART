 The main purpose of photosynthesis is to convert energy from sunlight and store it as bond
			energy within sugars. Photosynthesis uses pigments (such as chlorophyll) in the
			chloroplasts to absorb light energy. This energy is used to produce sugars from carbon
			dioxide, while oxygen is given off as a byproduct. You will examine the function of
			pigments in more detail later.
