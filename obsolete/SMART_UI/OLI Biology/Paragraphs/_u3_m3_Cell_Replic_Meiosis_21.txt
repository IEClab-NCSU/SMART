Meiosis II begins with two haploid cells, each containing too much DNA. Remember
			that while homologous pairs of chromosomes were separated in
				Meiosis I, each homologous chromosome is still connected to its sister
			chromatid. The presence of a sister chromatid for each chromosome
			at the start of Meiosis II means that each cell contains too much DNA. The events in
			meiosis II are almost identical to the events of mitosis.
