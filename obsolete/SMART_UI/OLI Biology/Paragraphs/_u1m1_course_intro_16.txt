Energy is required to sustain life and all living organisms need energy to fuel
					their metabolic activities. Some organisms get this energy directly from the sun
					through the process of photosynthesis. Other organisms harvest their energy from
					the food they eat. Humans are an example of organisms that obtain energy from
					food. In Unit 5: Metabolism, you will take a closer look at what energy
					is and explore how different cells acquire and use energy.
