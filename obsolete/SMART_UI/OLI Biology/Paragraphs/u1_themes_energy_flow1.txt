All cells (or organisms) take in forms of matter called nutrients and
                    release chemical waste products. Nutrients and wastes are made of atoms; they
                    occupy space and have mass. Organisms also must take in and use some form of
                    energy to grow, move, etc. and release waste energy as heat. Energy can be
                    defined as the capacity to do work or to make a change in the location,
                    temperature, or structure of matter. It cannot be weighed and does not take up
                    space, but it can be measured in terms of what it does The nutrients in a
                    sandwich can be weighed on a scale. The energy in the same sandwich can be
                    measured by burning it, capturing the released heat in water, and measuring how
                    much the waterâ€™s temperature increases as a result.
