In many, but not all, cases it is possible to pinpoint a phenotype to one allele.
            Remember, alleles are variants of genes, and genes code for proteins. In this example,
            the purple color may be due to an enzyme that produces a purple pigment. If the allele
            codes for a mutated enzyme that does not perform as expected, the resulting flower would
            be white. A flower with BB or Bb genotype has the normal enzyme — purple pigment is
            produced — and even the heterozygous flower, which has only one allele for the normal
            enzyme, produces enough pigment for the flower to be purple. The bb flower, on the other
            hand, has no functioning enzyme, so the flower remains white.
