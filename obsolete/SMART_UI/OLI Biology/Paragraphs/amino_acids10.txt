Proteins are polymers of amino acids. The amino acids are joined together by a
					condensation reaction similar to that described for the formation of the
					glycosidic bond in polysaccharides. Each amino acid in the polymer is referred
					to as a residue. Individual amino acids are joined together by the attack of the
					nitrogen of an amino group of one amino acid on the carbonyl carbon of the
					carboxyl group of another to create a covalent peptide bond and yield a molecule
					of water as shown below.
