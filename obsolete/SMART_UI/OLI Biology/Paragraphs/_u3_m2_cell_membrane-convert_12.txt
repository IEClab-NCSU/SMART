The phospholipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane. The
					bilayer's structure causes the membrane to be semipermeable. The hydrophobic core blocks the diffusion of hydrophilic ions and polar molecules. Small hydrophobic
					molecules and gases, which can dissolve in the membrane's core, cross it with
					ease.
