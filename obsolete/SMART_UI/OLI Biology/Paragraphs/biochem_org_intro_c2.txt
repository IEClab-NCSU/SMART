Different representations of methane, ammonia, and albuterol are shown in the
					table below. Formula gives the chemical formula,
						Molecular indicates how the atoms are bonded together,
						2D-Structural  provides some information about the
					three-dimensional structure using a two-dimensional drawing. The solid wedges
					indicate that the atoms are above the plane of the page and the dashed wedges
					indicate that the atoms are below the page. 3D-Structural images
					are seen in the Jmol images at the right of each row. You can manipulate the
					3D-structures by placing the cursor in the window and moving the mouse. You
					should understand the relationship between the 2D-structural representation and
					the 3D-structural representation. You should also take note of the standard
					color coding in 3D representations: usually carbon is gray, hydrogen is white,
					oxygen is red, nitrogen is blue, and sulfur is yellow.
