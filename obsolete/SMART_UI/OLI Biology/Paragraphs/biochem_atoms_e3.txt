Another example of radioactive isotopes is positron-emission tomography (PET). In PET, a
			patient ingests sugar that is marked with a radioactive isotope. Cells that are using a
			lot of sugar (or need a lot of energy) will absorb more of the radioactive isotope. The
			patient is then moved into a PET scanner, where the radioactive isotopes are visualized
			and the machine translates the data into an image. This can help in a variety of
			applications, from cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s disease diagnosis to addiction research (see
			image).
