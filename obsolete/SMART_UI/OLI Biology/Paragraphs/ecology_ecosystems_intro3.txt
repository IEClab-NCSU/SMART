In a healthy ecosystem, there is a continuous flow of energy that provides resources to
			sustain a diverse community of life. As we will explore in this module, energy starts in
			a nonliving form, usually as sunlight, and is captured and stored as chemical energy by
			producers. It then moves through chains of consumers, dissipating as heat along the way.
			A continuing supply of solar energy keeps this system in motion.
