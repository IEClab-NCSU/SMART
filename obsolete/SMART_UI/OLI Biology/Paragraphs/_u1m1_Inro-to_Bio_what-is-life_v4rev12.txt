Fact 4: Cells are defined by a boundary called a membrane. This
					membrane is made from an oily molecule (called a phospholipid) as well as
					proteins, carbohydrates, and other molecules. The purpose of this boundary is to
					define the inside and outside of the cell and to enable interactions with the
					environment. Cells also contain all of the machinery for growth and
					replication.
