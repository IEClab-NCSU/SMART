Proteins are the most functionally diverse group of biological macromolecules. Simply by
			stringing together amino acid building blocks in different combinations, structures are
			built that can function as enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions, provide structural
			support, transport substances in and out of the cell, and even transport substances
			around the body. Proteins can carry out this wide array of different functions because
			they can assume very different structures.
