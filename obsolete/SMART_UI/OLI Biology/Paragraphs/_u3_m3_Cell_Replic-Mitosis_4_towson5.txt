Mutations could cause proto-oncogenes to stop working properly. Mutations are
				errors in DNA that
				can result from genetic predisposition or environmental factors. Mutagens are chemicals
				in the environment that produce mutations. Carcinogens are specifically those mutagens
				that have shown that they can cause cancer. Cigarettes, for example, contain carcinogens
				that can alter the DNA and disrupt proper regulation of the cell cycle.
