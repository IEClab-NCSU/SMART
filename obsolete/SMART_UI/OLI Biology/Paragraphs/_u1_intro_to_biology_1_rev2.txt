As shown on the figure below, science can be broken down into two main branches -
					natural sciences and social and behavioral sciences. Social and behavioral
					sciences focus on human cultures and the behaviors of humans in groups and as
					individuals. Biology is a natural science. It encompasses many related
					sub-branches (e.g. ecology, biochemistry, and microbiology) that study different
					aspects of living organisms. In addition to biology, the other natural sciences
					are physical sciences like chemistry and physics. It is important to remember
					that even though science is broken down into branches and sub-branches of study,
					all of science is interconnected. For instance, to understand how a cell
					responds to a certain environmental signal, it is necessary to know about the
					chemical composition of that signal, so chemistry is important for biology.
					Likewise, understanding how the brain functions (neuroscience) can aid in the
					understanding of certain human behaviors, so biology is important for the social
					and behavioral sciences.
