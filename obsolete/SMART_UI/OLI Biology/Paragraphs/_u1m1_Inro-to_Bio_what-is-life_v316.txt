Cells are defined by a boundary called a membrane. This membrane is made
							from an oily molecule (called a phospholipid) as well as proteins,
							carbohydrates, and other molecules. The purpose of this boundary is to
							define the inside and outside of the cell and to interact with the
							environment. Cells also contain all of the machinery for growth and
							replication. Recall the structure of a virus and decide if it meets
							the definition of a cell.
