The intensive efforts to understand the structure of the molecules involved as well as the
      details of the process have also yielded a set of tools that have led to the sequencing of
      whole genomes containing the inherited information passed from generation to generation. This
      immense amount of information has spawned the field of computational biology that is able to
      extract information from the sequences that can be applied to both our basic understanding of
      the functioning of organisms and to applications leading to potential cures for genetically
      inherited diseases.
