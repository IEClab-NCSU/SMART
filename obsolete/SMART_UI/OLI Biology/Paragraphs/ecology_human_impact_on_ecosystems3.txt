Greenhouse gases are known to slow the escape of heat from Earth, and in this way
                they warm the climate through a mechanism called the greenhouse effect.
Humans have dramatically increased levels of greenhouse gases in the
                atmosphere.
The climate has warmed in parallel with and as a result of these changes in the
                atmosphere.
