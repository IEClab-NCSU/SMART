The storage and metabolism of glucose is controlled at the organ level by hormones. The
      hormones glucagon and insulin are secreted by the pancreas during periods of
      low or high blood sugar, respectively. Glucagon causes the liver to produce glucose from the
      storage polysaccharide glycogen or to synthesize glucose from pyruvate using the
      pathway gluconeogenesis. The released glucose enters into the blood and travels to
      muscle for oxidation by glycolysis leading to energy production. In contrast, insulin
      instructs the liver cell to store the excess glucose in the blood.
