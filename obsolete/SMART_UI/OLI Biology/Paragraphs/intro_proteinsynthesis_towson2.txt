Translation involves the conversion of a sequence of RNA to a corresponding sequence of
			amino acids. To perform the conversion a code is needed to translate from the four
			nucleotides (AUGC) of mRNA to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The question then
			is what combination of nucleotides can code for at least twenty different amino acids?
			Four nucleotides taken two at a time would generate 16 possible unique sequences. Not
			enough to code for 20 different amino acids. However, four nucleotides taken 3 at a time
			would generate 64 different unique sequences. Clearly this is enough to code for the 20
			naturally-occurring amino acids. In fact, the abundance of codes means that there is
			redundancy or degeneracy in the code with more than one triplet code representing a
			single amino acid.
