The science of ecology starts at the population level. Populations are groups of
                    organisms of the same species that live in a defined area. We can describe
                    populations in terms of their number (population size, N) and their density
                    (number per unit area or volume). Populations increase through the processes of
                    birth and immigration; they decrease through death and emigration. When
                    comparing processes like birth or death among populations, it is often useful to
                    calculate per capita rates (number of events per individual per unit time).
