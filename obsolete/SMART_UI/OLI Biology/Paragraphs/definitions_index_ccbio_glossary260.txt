A tabular categorization of all of the elements arranged in order of
                                increasing atomic number. Also called the Periodic Table, the table
                                is organized such that elements with similar properties are grouped
                                in the same column (called a chemical group) and elements with the
                                same number of electron shells appear in the same row (called a
                                period).
