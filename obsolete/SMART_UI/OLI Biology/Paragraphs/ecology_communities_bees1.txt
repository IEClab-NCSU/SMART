People are concerned about ecological community interactions for many reasons. For
			example, animal pollinators help us produce crops including almonds, soybeans, apples,
			tomatoes, coffee, cotton, and many more. In fact, over a third of global crop production
			depends on animal pollinators. Many of these crops are pollinated by domesticated
			honeybees. Originally native to Eurasia, honeybees were brought to North America by the
			earliest European settlers. Native Americans are said to have called them the “white
				man’s fly.” Honeybees and other pollinators transfer pollen from one flower to another,
			helping to increase seed and fruit yield.
