In the "Biological
					Macromolecules" unit, you explored matter and learned how
			atoms can be combined to form molecules that, through their own unique structures, are
			able to carry out specific functions. You learned that proteins,
			such as enzymes, are able to function like little molecular
			machines. However, enzymes and other biological macromolecules
			made of matter do not possess the properties of life. In fact, it is only after we
			combine these molecular building blocks to form a cell that we finally see the emergent
			property of life. Take a moment to review examples of each level of organization forming
			these building blocks using the activity below.
