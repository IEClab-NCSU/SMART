All matter can be classified into one of two categories: biotic (living) or
					abiotic (non-living). Something is considered biotic if it was ever alive at
					some point in time; in this sense, a dead human buried in a wooden coffin
					underground is still biotic, as is the wood used to make the coffin (the wood
					came from a tree that was once alive). However, not everything within, or made,
					by a biotic organism is biotic. For example, urea, a chemical component of
					urine, is abiotic.
