Nucleic acids are macromolecules that carry out two main functions in the cell: storage of
            genetic information and synthesis of proteins. Two types of nucleic acids specialize in
            these functions: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
                (RNA). DNA is the genetic material that stores information for making
            proteins in all living organisms. Some viruses store their genetic information in RNA
            instead of DNA. This may seem like an exception to the universal use of DNA as genetic
            material; however, recall that viruses are not
                cellular, and are not considered living organisms. The functions of
            nucleic acids are summarized in the table below.
