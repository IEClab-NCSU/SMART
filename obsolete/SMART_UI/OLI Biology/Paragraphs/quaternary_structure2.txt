There are many examples of proteins that require more than one peptide chain to be
          functional. In the case of the estrogen receptor two identical peptide chains come
          together to form the functional protein. This is called a homo dimer. Hemoglobin is
          composed of four peptide chains; two identical alpha chains and two identical beta chains.
          The individual peptides or sub-units of estrogen and hemoglobin are held together by all
          of the non-covalent bonding types: 
					hydrogen bonding, 
					ionic bonding and 
					
					
hydrophobic interactions
