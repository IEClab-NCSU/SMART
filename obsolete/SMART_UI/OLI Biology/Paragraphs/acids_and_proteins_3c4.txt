Unfortunately, in many adults the ability to produce lactase is diminished. Without adequate
				lactase, ingested lactose from milk and cheese is not broken down and absorbed in
				the small intestine. Instead, the lactose goes to the large intestine, where it is
				converted into large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas by the bacteria in the
				large intestine. These individuals are lactose intolerant and should avoid eating
				foods with high milk content.
