Jean-Baptist van Helmontâ€™s experiment shows that the carbon needed for photosynthesis
				does not come from the soil. However, the experiment does not indicate where the
				carbon does come from. A number of other studies conducted by scientists
				over many decades were required to show the precise source of the carbon. Today, we
				know that CO2 from the air is the source of carbon for
				photosynthesis.
