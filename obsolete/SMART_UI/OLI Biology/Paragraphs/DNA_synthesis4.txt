With formation of an open complex, one of the requirements for DNA polymerase is
            satisfied: single stranded DNA is generated. At either end of the open complex where the
            single stranded and double stranded DNA meet, a structure referred to as the
              replication fork exists. From this point we will focus on the process of
            replication at one of the replication forks. Remember that the replication will be occurring
            simultaneously from both forks in opposite directions. To allow the binding of DNA
            polymerase, a second requirement must be met for the structure of the substrate. An enzyme called Primase synthesizes a short
            (approximately 10 nucleotides), complementary RNA primer on each strand of the DNA in a
            5’ to 3’ unidirectional fashion. This complex of DNA and protein at the replication fork is referred to as the replisome.
