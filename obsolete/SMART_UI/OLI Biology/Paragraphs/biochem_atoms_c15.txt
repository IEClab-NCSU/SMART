Notice that the atomic
						mass or atomic weight on the periodic table is not generally a whole
					number. For example, the atomic mass of carbon (C) is 12.01. How is that
					possible? Atoms cannot have fractions of protons or neutrons. The reason for
					this is that not all atoms of an element have the same number of neutrons. For
					example, carbon atoms always have six protons. But some carbon atoms have six
					neutrons, while others have seven or even eight neutrons. A carbon atom that has
					six neutrons would have an atomic mass of 12; a carbon atom with eight neutrons
					would have an atomic mass of 14. Two atoms with the same atomic number
					but a different atomic mass are called isotopes. For example, most atoms of carbon
					have an atomic mass of 12. There are some atoms of carbon with an atomic mass of
					13 (carbon 13), and some with 14 (carbon 14). These are isotopes of the carbon
					atom. Carbon 12 is the most abundant or prevalent isotopic form of carbon.
					Because carbon 12 is the most abundant form and taking into account all of
					carbon's different isotopes, the average value for the atomic mass for carbon is
					near 12: it's listed at 12.01.
