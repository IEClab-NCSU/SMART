Other molecules require proteins to transport them across the
					membrane. Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions. The
						plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles
					each have unique collections of proteins. For example, to date more than 50
					kinds of proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells.
