Groupings of species in a community based on their feeding
                                relationships. These food based groupings are called trophic levels.
                                Trophic level 1 is composed of producers that form the base of all
                                ecosystems. Organisms in level 1 are eaten by organisms in level 2;
                                organisms in level 2 are eaten by organisms in level 3; organisms in
                                level 3 are by organisms in level 4, and so on.
