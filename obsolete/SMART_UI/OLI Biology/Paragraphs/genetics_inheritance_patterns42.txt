Some human traits (like the tongue-rolling ability) follow Mendelian patterns, which
            means they are controlled by a single gene. One of the alleles is dominant, and
            the other is recessive. Human genetic disorders following a Mendelian pattern
            are the least common. Most of those tend to be recessive, meaning that the defective
            allele causing the disorder is recessive. That means only homozygous recessive
            individuals will show the disorder. The heterozygotes will be carriers, so
            while they carry the defective allele (and sometimes even express it, as in the sickle
            cell trait), they phenotypically do not present the full disorder. Other disorders may
            be dominant, wherein the defective allele causing the disorder is dominant. In this
            case, the presence of only one allele is enough to provoke the appearance of the
            disorder, and only homozygous recessive individuals show the healthy phenotype.
