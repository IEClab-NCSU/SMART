In 1928, Alexander Fleming serendipitously discovered the first antibiotic, Penicillin.
					Fleming was studying bacteria in his lab and was growing different cultures on
					Petri dishes. He wasnâ€™t very tidy and had accidentally forgotten to clean some
					Petri dishes before leaving his lab for a monthlong vacation. When Fleming
					returned to the lab, he noticed that a mold had grown on one of the plates.
					Looking closely, Fleming saw that his bacteria had not grown well in a zone
					surrounding the moldy spots. Following up on a hunch, he deliberately added mold
					to some Petri dishes seeded with bacteria and found that all bacteria were
					killed near the mold colonies. By the mid-1940s, just in time to help wounded
					soldiers in World War II, scientists were able to mass-produce a drug derived
					from the mold discovered by Fleming.
