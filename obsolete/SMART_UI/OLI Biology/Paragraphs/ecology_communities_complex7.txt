What factors normally keep urchins in check? In the cold waters off the west coast of
			Alaska and Canada, evidence points to one factor as particularly critical: the presence
			of sea otters. Historically, humans hunted sea otters for their fur, nearly eliminating
			them by the late 1800s. More recently, sea otters have been reintroduced to many areas
			where they had been absent. Since the 1980s, researchers, including James Estes of the
			University of California Santa Cruz, have been tracking sea otter numbers and
			documenting their effects on marine communities in Alaska and off the coast of British
			Columbia. They have found that the sea otter is a keystone species in the kelp
			forest.
