At this point, you may wonder why the cell has to break
					down complex molecules in order to build them up again. Different cells use and
					require different biomolecules for their specialized functions. For example,
						carbohydrates are good sources of energy. In plants,
					carbohydrates are usually stored as starch. In animals, they are stored as
					glycogen. Both are polymers of glucose, but they have different
					structures, and an animal cell cannot readily store or access starch. When an
					athlete “carbo-loads” the evening before a race, starches from foods like pasta
					are digested to simple sugars in a catabolic reaction. They are then rebuilt as
					glycogen (in an anabolic reaction) in the muscles and liver. That way, there is
					some extra energy stored and easily accessible for the muscle cells to use for
					the big race. Biomolecules are broken down to raw materials, then rebuilt in a different form to meet the needs of the organism.
					One molecule that is unique to your cells is DNA. No other organism (except an
					identical twin) has the same DNA as you, so your cells need to build it anew in
					order to pass it on to the next generation
