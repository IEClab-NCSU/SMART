Cellulose, like glycogen and starch, is a polysaccharide that is made up of many
					glucose monosaccharides linked together. Cellulose is an important structural
					carbohydrate that provides support within plant cell walls. This carbohydrate is
					indigestible by humans and most animals. Some animals (e.g. cows, horses, and
					termites) can digest this carbohydrate. These animals have symbiotic (“living
					together”) bacteria that inhabit their digestive tract. The bacteria produce
					enzymes that break down cellulose, making sugar available to their hosts.
