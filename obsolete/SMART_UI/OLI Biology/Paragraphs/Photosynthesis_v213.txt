Water and light are essential for building sugar (C6H12O6), but neither of these contain carbon. To build sugar, photosynthesis needs a carbon source. Where do photosynthetic organisms get this carbon? Do they get it from the soil, through their roots (like they get water)? Jean-Baptist van Helmont designed an experiment to test this in the 1600â€™s. He planted a tree in a pot and watered it. He measured the weight of the soil and the tree both before and after the experiment. He found that the weight of the soil was approximately the same before and after, but the weight of the tree increased greatly.
