In our fox example it is important to remember that the environment did not
					change the alleles of individual foxes. The foxes did not all individually lose
					their coats as the weather got warmer. Instead, the environmental conditions
					changed the likelihood that a particular set of alleles would be passed from
					individuals in one generation to their descendants. The environment increased
					the odds that the f allele would be passed on to the next
					generation, and decreased the odds that the F allele would
					be passed on. As a result, the frequency of the FF
					genotypes in the population's gene pool decreased while the frequency of
					the ff types increased. We see this change in frequency
					reflected in an increase in the percentage of foxes in the population that are born with genes for a thin coat (i.e., we
					observe a change in the frequency of the thin coat phenotype). Evolution takes
					longer than a lifetime. Second, the warmer climate did not cause a mutation to
					occur so that thinner coats could exist. Instead,
					selection is limited to filtering existing variation. Diversity already exists
					within the alleles of a population and the environment places a selective
					pressure on that population. The evolution of a population is a reactive and
					automatic process, not a planned or deliberate one.
