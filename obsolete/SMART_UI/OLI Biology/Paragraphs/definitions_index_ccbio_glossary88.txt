Chemical bonds that form molecules and are a result of sharing of
                                electrons; electrons can be shared equally (non-polar covalent) or
                                unequally (polar covalent). In the diagram below that illustrates
                                the formation of a methane molecule, the carbon atom shares each of
                                its four (4) valence electrons with one hydrogen atom, which in turn
                                shares its one valence electron with the carbon atom.
