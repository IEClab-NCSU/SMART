While it is clear that the regulation of pH in living organisms is crucial to
					their survival, the pH in the environment is just as important to maintaining
					life on this planet. Different environments have different pH levels, and
					organisms that live in those locations have adapted to those conditions. When
					environmental pH levels are disrupted, the health and vitality of the ecosystem
					becomes threatened.
