During the Agricultural Age, humans cleared forests and created dams and
                    irrigation systems. These actions harmed many species and benefited others. In
                    some cases, resources like forests or fertile soils were depleted on a local or
                    regional scale, contributing to the collapse of human societies. Throughout this
                    history, however, human impacts on the environment were limited in their scope
                    and severity.
