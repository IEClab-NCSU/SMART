Energy enters ecosystems as sunlight and dissipates from all living things as heat.  Producers (trophic level 1) have access to the greatest amount of energy (sunlight).  As they grow, they store up food calories that supply all consumers with energy. Consumers feed on producers directly (trophic level 2) or feed on each other through a series of transfers that can be described as a food chain.  The amount of energy available to consumers declines by about 90% with each transfer, so top predators at the end of long food chains tend to be rare.
