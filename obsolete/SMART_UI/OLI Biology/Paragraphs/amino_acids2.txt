 Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. The sequence of amino acids in
					individual proteins is encoded in the DNA of the cell. The physical and chemical
					properties of the 20 different, naturally occurring amino acids dictate the
					shape of the protein and its interactions with its environment. Certain short
					sequences of amino acids in the protein also dictate where the protein resides
					in the cell. Proteins are composed of hundreds to thousands of amino acids. As
					you can imagine, protein folding is a complicated process and there are many
					potential shapes due to the large number of combinations of amino acids. By
					understanding the properties of the amino acids you will get an appreciation for
					the limits of protein folding and how to predict the potential higher order
					structure of the protein.
