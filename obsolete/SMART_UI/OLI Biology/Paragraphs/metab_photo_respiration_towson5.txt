This is how the cycling between photosynthesis and cellular respiration occurs: in
					photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light energy, are
					converted to make glucose and oxygen; while in cellular respiration, the
					products of photosynthesis (glucose and oxygen) are metabolized to make energy
					in the form of ATP and heat, releasing carbon dioxide and water. Because each
					process starts where the other ends, they form a cycle.
