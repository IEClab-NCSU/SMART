Many pathways are universal among living organisms. When
					you look at life, you may see a great deal of diversity. Those who study
					metabolism, by contrast, see a huge degree of overlap among the cells of all
					living things. Many of the fundamental enzymes that keep our cells working are
					found in only slightly different forms in creatures as varied as zebrafish,
					fruit flies, yeast, and nematode worms. This is partly why studies on model
					organisms can teach us so much about our own biology.
