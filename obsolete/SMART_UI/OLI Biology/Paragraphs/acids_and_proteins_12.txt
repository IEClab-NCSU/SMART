Amino acids are small organic chemicals that can be identified by their common
			structures. All amino acids have a nitrogen containing amino group, a carboxylic acid
			group, and and a single carbon between the amino and carboxylic acid groups. This carbon
			is called the alpha carbon since it is directly attached to the carboxyl group. The
			amino differ in the nature of the organic group that is attached to the central alpha
			carbon. The different organic groups are referred to as “R-groups”. There are 20
			different R-groups commonly found in nature. Thus amino acids are identical except for
			the different R-groups attached to the alpha carbon. The properties of different
			proteins depends entirely on the sequence, or arrangement of the amino acids.
