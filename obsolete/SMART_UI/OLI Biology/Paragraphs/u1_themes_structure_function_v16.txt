Structure also determines function at higher levels of biological organization. Your body’s
			organs function as they do because of how tissues are put together, forming filters,
			pumps, levers, surfaces for gas exchange, and pipes for air and fluid flow. And, of
			course, the entire body of an organism is suited to its lifestyle and environment. For
			example, the earthworm is well-suited for burrowing: it is slimy, muscular, flexible,
			and cylindrical. Yet there are many surprising details in the worm’s structure. The next
			time you get the chance, feel an earthworm. Pinch it carefully
			near the head with one hand, then rub your free forefinger against its belly. You’ll
			notice prickly hairs on the worm’s underside. And you’ll find that you only feel them
			when you move your finger toward the worm’s head: the hairs are set at an angle,
			enabling the worm to grip the soil to and move it forward through the earth.
