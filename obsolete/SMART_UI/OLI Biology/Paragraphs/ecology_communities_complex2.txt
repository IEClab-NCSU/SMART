One way to simplify the problem is to focus on a few particularly important species.
			Species that are physically dominant (largest and/or most abundant) in communities are
			sometimes called foundation species. They include the most abundant
			trees within terrestrial forests, common grasses within grasslands, and reef-building
			corals. Foundation species directly provide habitat and often food for most of the other
			species in the community. Anything that threatens their well-being is likely to harm
			many other species as well.
