Red blood cells transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
White blood cells fight infection by attacking foreign cells,
                        and clear old or diseased cells.
Platelets are important for hemostasis (not to be confused with
                        homeostasis); hemostasis is our ability to stop bleeding after vascular
                        injury (injury to blood vessels).
