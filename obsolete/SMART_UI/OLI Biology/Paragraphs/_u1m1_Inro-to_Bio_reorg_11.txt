We are happy you have joined us in our exploration of the fundamental principles
					of biology. Before we begin, we should consider what biology actually is.
					Biology is the scientific study of life. Biologists study living organisms and
					the way organisms interact with their environments. The subject is vast and
					includes topics as diverse as acid rain, evolution, and genetically modified
					foods.
