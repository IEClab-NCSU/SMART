Virtually all the activities of the cell are powered by the energy released when
					ATP loses its terminal phosphate. For example, ATP hydrolysis provides the
					energy needed to form complex molecules from simpler ones (synthesis). ATP can
					also transfer energy by making proteins change shape when ATP is converted to
					ADP. When proteins change shape, their microscopic movements can add up to
					macroscopic motion, such as occurs when entire muscles contract. Similarly, ATP
					can transfer energy to specialized transport proteins embedded in the cell
					membrane and enable materials to be pumped in or out of the cell, against their
					concentration gradients (active transport).
