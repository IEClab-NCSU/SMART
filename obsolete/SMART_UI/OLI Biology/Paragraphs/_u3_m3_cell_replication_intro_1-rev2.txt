Meiosis, on the other hand, is a type of cell division that prepares an
					organism for sexual reproduction. Meiosis begins with germ cells. Be
					careful not to confuse “germ cells” with the common use of the word “germ”,
					which refers to any infectious microorganism. In humans, germ cells are found in
					the ovaries and testes. These germ cells go through the process of meiosis to
					produce gametes, which in animals, are sperm and egg cells. When two gametes
					from different individuals combine, a unique new cell is produced, called a
						zygote. This single cell then goes through the process of mitosis
					to grow into a new individual.
