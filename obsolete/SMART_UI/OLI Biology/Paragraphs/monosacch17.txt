Examination of the result of this transformation, in which the total number of carbons,
			hydrogens and oxygens between the two structures has not changed, shows that the number
			one carbon has now become a new asymmetric (chiral) center where it wasnâ€™t before the ring
			closure. This new chiral center is called the anomeric carbon. You should examine this structure and
				convince yourself that the four different substituents attached to the anomeric carbon are
				unique, making it a chiral center.
