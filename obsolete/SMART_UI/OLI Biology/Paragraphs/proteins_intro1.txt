Proteins are the most functionally diverse group of biomolecules we will examine in this
            unit. Critical to our diet, protein can be found in animal products like meats and
            cheeses, as well as in plant products like beans and grains. Kwashiorkor, which causes a
            distinct swelling of the abdomen, is often seen in malnourished children who lack
            sufficient protein in their diets. Proteins are also found in many toxins, such as the
            incredibly poisonous toxin produced by the bacterial species Clostridium botulinum.
            Studies have shown that just one teaspoon of this poison, which is a protein, would be
            enough to kill 20 percent of the worldâ€™s population! This module will take a closer look
            at the structure of a protein and examine how protein structure enables such a wide
            range of diverse functions.
