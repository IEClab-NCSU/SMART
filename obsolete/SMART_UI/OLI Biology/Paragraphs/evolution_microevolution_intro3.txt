In this course we will define a species as a group of organisms
			whose members can and will breed with each other to produce fertile offspring. A population is all the individuals of the same species that occupy
			the same area and are likely to breed with one another. Some examples of a population
			might be all the people that live in your state, all of the frogs that live near a pond,
			all of the grizzly bears that live in Denali National Park, or all the dandelions that
			live in your hometown.
