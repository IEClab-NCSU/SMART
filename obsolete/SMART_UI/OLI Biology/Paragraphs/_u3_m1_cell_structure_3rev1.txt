All eukaryotes contain a nucleus. Animals and plants are familiar
			eukaryotes; in fact, all large complex organisms are eukaryotes.
				Fungi (the singular form is "fungus"), which include molds and
			mushrooms, are also eukaryotes. There are even single-celled eukaryotes, called
					protists. All eukaryotes have a nucleus, but they can also
			have other cell structures in common.
