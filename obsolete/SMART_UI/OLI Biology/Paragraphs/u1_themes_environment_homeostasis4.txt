 Structo is just a blob floating in the ocean, and itâ€™s not functioning too well at
                the moment. Structo needs a part that will allow it to exchange gases between its
                blood and the surrounding water. It cannot breathe through simple diffusion of gases
                across the surface of its body -- like a jellyfish or sponge is able to do. Instead,
                it needs a specialized structure to get rid of a waste gas (carbon dioxide) and take
                in oxygen gas.
