 A third function for carbohydrates is that of cell recognition and signaling. Just
			as we identified a peptido-glycan as a conjunction (conjugation) of a peptide with a
			polysaccharide, other complex carbohydrates are conjugated to other molecules to form
			glycoproteins (carbohydrates linked to proteins) and glycolipids (carbohydrates linked
			to lipids). Because a very large number of structures can be made from a few
			monosaccharides (simple carbohydrates), a very large number of different structures can
			be made from a few simple carbohydrates, as will be seen later. This large number of
			different structures can therefore be used as unique signals for identification of
			individual cell types.
