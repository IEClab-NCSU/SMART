Since DNA synthesis is always unidirectional from 5’ to 3’, it is necessary to lengthen
          the 3’ end of the chromosome such that primer directed synthesis can take place to
          lengthen the shorter 5’ end of the chromosome. While the staggered end of the chromosome
          is not avoided, the net length of the chromosome is recovered or even lengthened. The
          diagrams below demonstrate how lengthening of the chromosome can be accomplished using the
          enzyme telomerase. The telomerase enzyme is a polymerase like enzyme that carries
          its own template with the template having overlap complementarity with the 3’ end of the
          chromosome. The criteria for polymerization are met, a template and a primer with a free
          3’ hydroxyl, and the telomerase lengthens the 3’ strand of the chromosome. This process of
          lengthening is repeated until a the normal replication process lays down a RNA primer
          using the primase enzyme, DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA from the 3’ end of the RNA
          primer and DNA ligase joins the newly synthesized DNA to the 5’ end of the chromosome.
