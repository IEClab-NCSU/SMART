 The second function for the carbohydrates is structure. In this case, structure is not only
			what a polymer of the carbohydrates has, but it is also what that structure contributes
			to the cell. For example, cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose that interacts with
			other cellulose polymers to form fibers that interact to form the basic structure of the
			cell wall of plants.
