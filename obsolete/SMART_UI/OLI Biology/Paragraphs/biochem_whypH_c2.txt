As you have learned, seawater is slightly basic at pH 8. The oceans and the organisms that
				live in them play a critical role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon
				dioxide on this planet. You will learn more about this in the Photosynthesis /
				Cellular Respiration module in the Metabolism unit. With the increased burning of
				fossil fuels in the modern industrial society, more man-made carbon dioxide
					(CO2) is being released into the environment than ever before. Much
				of this carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans. When carbon dioxide is absorbed
				into water, carbonic acid is produced. This then dissociates to produce bicarbonate
				ions and hydrogen ions, and the pH of the ocean is lowered. Acidification of the
				ocean threatens the health of the organisms that call the ocean home. Many marine
				life forms, including reef-building corals, are harmed or killed when ocean water is
				acidified. As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere continue to climb, there is
				great concern about the worsening impact of ocean acidification.
