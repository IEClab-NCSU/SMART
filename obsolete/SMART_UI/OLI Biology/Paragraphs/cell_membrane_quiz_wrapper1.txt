The ability to carefully regulate substances moving in and out of the cell is
					crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. There are many ways items can get
					in and out of the cell. Some substances can move through simple diffusion.
					Others require a transport protein. Sometimes energy is needed and sometimes it
					is not. Membrane transport proteins are so important that serious diseases can
					result when they malfunction.
