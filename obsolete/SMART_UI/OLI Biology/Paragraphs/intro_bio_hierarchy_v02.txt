Life is organized on hierarchical levels of increasing complexity. Biologists look at all levels of aspects of life, past and present. 
				This journey takes them all the way down to atoms and molecules, and all the way up to global relationships among organisms and the environment. 
				As we ascend to more and more complex levels, emergent properties appear. These are characteristics of a system that do not appear in any of its 
				component parts. Think about a photograph. A photograph will show a composition conveying a message. Can you explain that composition based only 
				on the tiny pixels (dots) that make up the image? A more biological example would be life, an emergent property that appears at the cellular level. 
				Molecules are not alive, but they are the components of life.
