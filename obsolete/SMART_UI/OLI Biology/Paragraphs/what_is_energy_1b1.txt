 Energy can be converted from one form to another. In the image below, the chemical energy in
			the wood is converted to light and heat. After the fire dies, the heat and light have
			dissipated and are no longer available for living organisms. Energy in our biosphere is
			a one-way system: It comes from the sun, is captured by living organisms, and eventually
			is released back out as heat.
