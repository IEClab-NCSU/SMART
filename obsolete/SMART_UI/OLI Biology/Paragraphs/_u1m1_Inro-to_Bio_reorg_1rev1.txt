The purpose of this course introduction is to prepare you conceptually and technically for the
			course. Since you may not have experienced an online course like this before, we will
			start with a short section describing the course and offer some learning strategies that
			will help you use the materials most efficiently. Finally, we will discuss what biology
			is all about — the "big
			picture"
			— our framework for exploring the relationship between the themes in
			biological research and the fundamental concepts and principles included in this course.
