After Darwin, science has continued to reinforce, refine, and modify the theory of
            evolution. Two major developments were particularly important. In the early 1900s,
            scientists rediscovered Mendelâ€™s genetic principles and applied them to evolution.
            Theorists developed models of how the gene pool of a population could change over time.
            Field biologists observed such changes in fruit flies and other short-lived organisms.
            Lab experiments also demonstrated the effects of natural selection. With a focus on
            genetics, these advances reinforced the idea of natural selection. In 1953 James Watson
            and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA. This laid the groundwork for an
            explosion of information that continues today. Inherited information now can be analyzed
            directly and in detail. Comparisons of DNA in different species support their common
            ancestry. DNA analysis also pinpoints the genetic mutations that produce new adaptive
            traits in organisms. To Learn More: A comprehensive database of Darwin-related
