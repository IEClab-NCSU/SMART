On the previous page you determined that the most stable complimentary base pairing takes place between A and T with two hydrogen bonds and between G and C with three hydrogen bonds in DNA. Combining that finding with the backbone information that described DNA as containing A, T, G, and C as the possible bases and A, U, G, and C as the possible bases in RNA, the complimentary base pairing in RNA would include A with U (examine the difference in structure between T and U) with two hydrogen bonds and G with C as described in DNA. In each case these comlimentary base pairings included a purine hydrogen bonded to a pyrimidine. This means that the distance between the attachment sites for the sugar in all the base pairs are identical giving uniform dimensions to the distance between the two backbones along the length of two strands that are hydrogen bonded together.
