The biological membrane is a collage of many different proteins embedded in the
					fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer. The lipid bilayer is the main fabric of the
					membrane, and its structure creates a semi-permeable membrane. The hydrophobic
					core impedes the diffusion of hydrophilic structures, such as ions and polar
					molecules but allows hydrophobic molecules, which can dissolve in the membrane,
					to cross it with ease. Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific
					functions. The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each
					have unique collections of proteins. For example, to date more than 50 kinds of
					proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells.
