 In the same way that the larger aldoses were generated, single carbons can be added to
the structure of the dihydroxyacetone and an expansive tree of structures
result. If we examine the result of adding a single carbon, the result is the acquisition
of an new asymmetric center.  In the case of a four carbon ketose, which is formed by the addition of  a C(H2O) group below the ketone group in dihydroxyacetone phosphate, the new chiral center can be either  D or  L. In general, only the D structures of the ketoses are used by biological
systems due to bioselectivity.
