The ability of a molecule to pass through the membrane depends on its polarity and to
			some extent its size. Many non-polar molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small
			hydrocarbons can flow easily through cell membranes. This feature of membranes is very
			important because hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in our blood, is contained
			within red blood cells. Oxygen must be able to freely cross the membrane so that
			hemoglobin can get fully loaded with oxygen in our lungs, and deliver it effectively to
			our tissues. Most polar substances are stopped by a cell membrane, except perhaps for
			small polar compounds like the one carbon alcohol, methanol and water. Glucose is too large to
			pass through the membrane unassisted and a special transporter protein ferries it
			across. Certain types of diabetes are caused by misregulation of the glucose
			transporter. Charged ions, such as sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+) ions seldom go through
			a membrane, consequently they also need special transporter molecules to pass through
			the membrane. The inability of Na+ and K+ to pass through the membrane allows the cell
			to regulation the concentrations of these ions on the inside or outside of the cell. The
			conduction of electrical signals in your nerves is based on the ability of cells to
			control Na+ and K+ levels.
