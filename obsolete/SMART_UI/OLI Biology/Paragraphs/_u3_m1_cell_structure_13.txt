By the late 1830s, scientists had closely examined many plant and animal tissues under the 
			microscope.  Comparing notes, botanist, Matthias Schleiden, and zoologist, Theodor Schwann,
			realized that cells were found in every tissue they had studied.  They proposed the 
			Unified Cell Theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or 
			more cells, and that the cell is the basic unit of life.
		
			You, for instance, are made of approximately 60 trillion cells, all of which originated
			from one single cell, the fertilized cell produced when an egg from your mother was
			fertilized by the sperm cell from your father.
