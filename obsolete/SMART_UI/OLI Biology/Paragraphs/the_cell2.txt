Above is a caricature of a eukaryotic cell. Many of the cell components are hyper links that will
provide you with an image showing these same structures in a living cell. This
illustration highlights one of the goals of the course which is to expand your view of
biology by bridging from classic simple illustrations to images generated from actual
data. In addition, you will develop an understanding of the fundamental processes used
in this imaging method.
