Transfer 2: tomato plant â†’ caterpillar.  Much of the energy in the leaf material eaten by a caterpillar is not digested and is excreted in feces.  Of the energy that is absorbed, most is used in aerobic respiration and is released as heat.  Only about 10% is stored as calories in the molecules (fats, proteins, etc.) that make up the tissues of the caterpillar.
