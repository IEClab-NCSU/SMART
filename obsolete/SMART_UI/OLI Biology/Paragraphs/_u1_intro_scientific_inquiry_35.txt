Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also influence the results
			of the experiment. Without saying so directly, the doctor may show — through body
			language or other subtle cues — his or her views about whether the patient is likely to
			get well. These errors can then alter the patient’s experience and change the results of
			the experiment. Therefore, many clinical studies are “double blind.” In these studies,
			neither the doctor nor the patient knows which group the patient is in until all
			experimental results have been collected.
