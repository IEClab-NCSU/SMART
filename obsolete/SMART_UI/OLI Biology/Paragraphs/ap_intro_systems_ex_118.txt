Skeletal muscles are made of long cylinder shaped cells called muscle
                        fibers, which have many nuclei within each cell. Therefore we say
                    that skeletal muscle is multi-nucleate. The functional unit within a skeletal
                    muscle fiber, called a sarcomere (note that “sarc” means flesh),
                    contains filaments of the proteins actin and myosin. Myosin is a thicker protein
                    (appears darker) than actin and the two proteins create a pattern so the muscle
                    appears striped or striated. Notice the appearance of skeletal muscle in this
                    transmission electron microscope view.
