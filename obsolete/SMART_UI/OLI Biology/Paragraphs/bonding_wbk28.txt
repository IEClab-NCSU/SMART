 The final type of interaction occurs between neutral, hydrophobic , or
					water-fearing, molecules. These molecules do not interact with water and are
					characterized by a complete lack of electronegative atoms. In aqueous solutions
					the hydrophobic molecules are driven together to the exclusion of water. For
					example, shaking a bottle of oil and vinegar (acetic acid in water), such as in
					a salad dressing, results in the oil being dispersed as tiny droplets in the
					vinegar. As the mixture settles, the oil collects in larger and larger drops
					until it only exists as a layer, or phase, above the vinegar.
