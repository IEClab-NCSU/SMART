Are all wavelengths of light equally useful for photosynthesis? In 1883, a scientist named George Englemann designed an experiment to answer this question. He shined a light through a prism to separate the different wavelengths of light. These different wavelengths shone on different areas of an algae (called Spirogyra).  From this experiment, Englemann ws able to determine which wavelengths of light were most utilized by algae in photosynthesis.
