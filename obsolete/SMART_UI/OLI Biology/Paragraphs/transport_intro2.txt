The cell membrane provides a semi-permeable barrier between the inside and the outside of
			the cell. This barrier provides control for transport of nutrients, ions and signals
			between the highly variable outside environment and the relatively well-defined interior
			of the cell. This unit of the course will explore the ways in which molecules can pass
			across the membrane (diffusion and active transport), can be transported into the cell
			without passing across the membrane (endocytosis), and can send signals for actions
			within the cell without actually passing across the membrane themselves (signal
			transduction).
