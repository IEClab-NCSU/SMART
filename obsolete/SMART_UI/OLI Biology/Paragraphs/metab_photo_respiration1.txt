As you may recall, photosynthesis occurs in some bacteria; in eukaryotes it occurs in
			cells that contain chloroplasts. Such cells are found in algae and in the leaves and
			stems of plants. Photosynthetic organisms use light energy and simple building blocks
			(carbon dioxide and water) to make their own food. Cellular respiration is very
			widespread. It is completed in mitochondria, bacteria-like organelles that are found in
			protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Although the details of the two pathways are
			different, the overall reaction of cellular respiration is photosynthesis running in
			reverse. Cellular respiration extracts the stored energy from food molecules, uses it to
			“charge up” ATP, and releases carbon dioxide and water as wastes.
