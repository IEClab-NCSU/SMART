Stone Age. By 50,000 years ago, humans had developed many
            features of Stone Age technology and culture. By 20,000 years ago, modern humans
            had dispersed through much of the world. Stone Age humans obtained food by
            fishing, hunting wild game, and gathering wild plant products. Food sources were
            unreliable and most humans were nomadic, traveling widely to find food. Shelter,
            clothing, and tools were made from stone, animal hides, and wood. Fire was used
            as a source of heat and to modify the landscape for better hunting or travel.
            Human labor was the main energy source.
