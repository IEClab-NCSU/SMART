Oxygen is not used in fermentation, and although some CO2
					may be produced, glucose is not fully broken down. Instead, fermentation ends
					with complex products (lactate, ethanol) that still contain quite a bit of
					chemical potential energy. The breakdown process is incomplete, and relatively
					little energy is available to drive the production of ATP. In addition, the
					byproducts of fermentation can be toxic. For example, a buildup of lactic acid
					may cause stiffness in an overworked muscle.
