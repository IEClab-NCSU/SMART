The idea of common ancestry is very strongly supported by many lines of evidence. Like
            plagiarized term papers, our genes contain many sequences that closely match those in
            other species. Body structures and patterns of embryological development tell the same
            story. And fossils provide a historic record of the traits of our ancestors. You will
            see some such evidence in this Module.
