The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the citric acid
          cycle, is a central pathway in the metabolism of all organisms. Not only is this pathway
          the next step for the oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, it also plays a key role in
          amino acid metabolism. All carbons that enter the TCA cycle, regardless of their source,
          are fully oxidized to carbon dioxide. The electrons that are released from these
          oxidations are stored on NADH and FADH2 for subsequent processing by the
          electron transport chain.
