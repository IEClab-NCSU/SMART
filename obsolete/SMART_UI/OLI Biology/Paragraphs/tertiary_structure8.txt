Protein folding and stabilization is driven primarily by non-covalent
					interactions. -helices and -sheets are stabilized by hydrogen
					bonding. Tertiary structure is driven and stabilized by hydrophobic interactions
					and involves all types of non-covalent bonding. As you will see in the next
					page, quaternary structure is stabilized primarily by all types of
					complimentary, non-covalent interactions. One covalent bond is possible and is
					formed when two cysteine amino acids (sulfhydryl containing side chain) are
					close together as a result of tertiary structure formation. The sulfhydryl group
					is highly reactive and will covalently bond with another sulfhydryl group to
					form a covalent disulfide bond (a cystine residue). Disulfide bonds also form
					between peptide chains in forming quaternary structure, for example in the
					structure of antibodies. The disulfide bond is reversible and is sensitive to
					the environment.
