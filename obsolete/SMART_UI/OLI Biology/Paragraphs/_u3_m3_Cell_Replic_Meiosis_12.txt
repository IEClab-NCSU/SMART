Asexual reproduction is efficient and fast. However, it only provides one set of
					genes to adapt to the environment. Think about it like a set of lottery numbers.
					Do you have more chances of winning if you play only one number or if you play
					ten numbers? Sexual reproduction, in which the genes of two parents are
					combined, results in more genetic variability. This enables offspring to deal
					more successfully with environmental change, although sexual reproduction is a
					more complex process and results in a smaller number of offspring.
					Interestingly, certain organisms that can reproduce both asexually and sexually
					will choose sexual reproduction only when environmental conditions are not
					optimal. That way, a smaller number of more variable, and thus more adaptable,
					offspring is produced. In optimal conditions, however, asexual reproduction is
					the favored mechanism.
