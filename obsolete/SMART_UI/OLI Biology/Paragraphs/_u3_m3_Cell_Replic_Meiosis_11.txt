There are two ways for organisms to reproduce: asexual and sexual. Many
					organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and even some plants and animals, reproduce
					asexually. During asexual reproduction, all of the genes in a cell are passed to
					its daughter cells. This means that the resulting cells are clones or identical copies of the parental cell.
