A eukaryotic genome resides on multiple linear DNA molecules in the nucleus. Each of
            these DNA molecules is called a chromosome. Eukaryotic cells
            also contain DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts; mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes
            are circular like those of bacteria, and are typically considered separately from
            eukaryotic genomes.
