People with cystic fibrosis have respiratory difficulties, usually caused by
					unusually thick mucus in the respiratory tubes in the lungs. In the lungs, CFTR
					transporters secrete chloride ions into the center of the respiratory tubes.
					This increases the concentration of solutes in the mucus lining the tubes, which
					in turn causes water to flow into the space inside the tubes (yellow). Under
					normal conditions, this process allows for a runny mucus to line the tubes.
