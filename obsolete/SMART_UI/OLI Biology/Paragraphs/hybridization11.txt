 the chains are antiparallel
 the two chains are held together by hydrogen bonding between bases
 the stability of the DNA is directly proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds between chains
 hydrogen bonding between strands of DNA and RNA follow the pattern
        
A hydrogen bonded through two bonds to T in DNA
A hydrogen bonded through two bonds to U in RNA
G hydrogen bonded through three bonds to C in both DNA and RNA
