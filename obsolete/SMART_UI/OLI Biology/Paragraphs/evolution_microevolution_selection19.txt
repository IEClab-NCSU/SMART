Female peafowl are more likely to mate with males that have fuller, more
					colorful, and more grandiose tail plumage. During mating season, males display
					their plumage when females are in the area in the hopes of attracting the
					females for mating. The males with the better tail feathers are more likely to
					successfully mate and pass on their genes.
