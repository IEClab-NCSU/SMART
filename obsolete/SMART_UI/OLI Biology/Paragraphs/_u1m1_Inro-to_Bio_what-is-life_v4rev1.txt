Have you ever gotten sick with the flu and said something like, “I’ve come down with a bug,” or
			“I’ve got the flu bug”? In fact, the flu (short for influenza) is not really caused by a
			“bug” at all. It is caused by a virus, and there is some controversy in the scientific
			community regarding whether or not viruses are alive. But what are viruses, really? And
			how would you determine whether or not they are alive? In this lesson, you’ll learn more
			about what viruses are, so you can figure out if they are actually alive.
