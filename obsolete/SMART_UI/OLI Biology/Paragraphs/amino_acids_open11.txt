 The resulting peptide chain is linear, defined by the mechanism that builds the
					polymer, and has defined ends. Short polymers (< 50 residues or amino
					acids) are usually refereed to as peptides, and longer polymers as proteins.
					Because the synthesis takes place from the alpha amino group of one amino acid
					to the carboxyl group of another amino acid, the result is that there will
					always be a free amino group on one end of the growing polymer (the N-terminus)
					and a free carboxyl group on the other end (the C-terminus). Note that the
					potential exists for the formation of amide (peptide) links involving the
					carboxyl and amino groups in the side chains, but bioselectivity directs the
					synthesis to be linear, involving only the alpha amino and alpha carboxyl
					groups.
