 Before defining the modern theory of evolution, we will consider its historic roots. You
            probably know that the scholar most widely recognized as the author of the theory of
            evolution was Charles Darwin. The first statement of modern evolutionary theory was his
            book On the Origin of Species, published in 1859. But Darwin didn’t make up the theory
            from nothing, and he wasn’t the first to ask questions about the ultimate origins of
            life. How did science deal with life’s big “why” questions before evolutionary theory
            developed? What clues led scientists to propose and embrace evolution? To gain some
            insights into these questions, explore the Learn By Doing activity below.
