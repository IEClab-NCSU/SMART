 The estrogen receptor binds to estrogen and this causes estrogen receptor to bind to DNA
			and turn genes on and off. The result in some cells is the commencement of cell division. When estrogen
			falls off, estrogen can no longer bind DNA and division may stop. If estrogen did not
			dissociate from the estrogen receptor then cell division could not be controlled and
			cancer could result.
