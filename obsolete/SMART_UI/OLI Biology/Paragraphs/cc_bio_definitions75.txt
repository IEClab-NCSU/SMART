Process in which characteristics of a population change predictably over many
                        generations. Selection takes forms such as natural selection (favors traits
                        that aid in survival to reproductive age), sexual selection (favors traits
                        that boost mating success), and artificial selection (favors traits that are
                        chosen by human breeders).
