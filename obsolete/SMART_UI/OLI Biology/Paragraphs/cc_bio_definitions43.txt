Human activities destroy or change habitat so that it no longer supports the growth and reproduction of a species.  This is widely acknowledged as the most important direct threat to biodiversity worldwide.  Habitats that have been profoundly changed by human activities include forests (clearing), grasslands (plowing and overgrazing), rivers (damming), and wetlands (draining).
