Mendel set out to understand inheritance by breeding pea plants. By collecting peas from
            pods produced after fertilizing two parent pea plants, Mendel could then grow those peas
            into new pea plants and see how these offspring resemble or differ from the parent
            plants. The heritable characteristics that Mendel studied included seed color and shape,
            pod color and shape, flower color and position, and stem length. Each of the traits that
            Mendel studied occurs only in two forms, or phenotypes. For instance, pea flower color
            is a trait that can exhibit either the purple phenotype or the white phenotype.
