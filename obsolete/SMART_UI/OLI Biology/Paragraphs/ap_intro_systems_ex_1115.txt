Cardiac muscle contains similarities to both skeletal and smooth
                    muscle. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is composed of organized muscle
                    fibers and sarcomeres, and is striated. However, cardiac muscle does not attach
                    to the skeletal system and is under involuntary control, and is uninucleate.
                    Cardiac muscle is not long and cylinder shaped like skeletal muscle but is more
                    branched.
