This course has looked closely at the water molecule because it is vital to life.
					Water covers 70 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface and the cell, the fundamental unit of life, consists
					of 70 to 95 percent water. In this module, we will examine one very small (and
					simple) substance that, when dissolved in water, can have an enormous impact on
					life: the hydrogen ion (H+). Hydrogen ions are hydrogen atoms that
					have had their electrons removed. What remains is only a single proton. The
					simplicity of this ion, however, is quite misleading. In this module, we will
					investigate the dynamics of H+ and learn more about the effects
						H+ can have on solutions.
