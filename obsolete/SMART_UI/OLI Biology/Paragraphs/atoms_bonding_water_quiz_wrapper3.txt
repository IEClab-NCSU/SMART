The polar nature of water makes it a good solvent for other polar compounds, like ATP or
                    glucose. The ability of water to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules has
                    important biological consequences, such as reducing the density of ice such that it
                    floats. Can you describe the other biologically significant properties of water? Another
                    important aspect of biological solutions is pH, or the hydrogen ion concentration. You
                    should be able to distinguish between an acid and a base and be able to discuss the
                    importance of buffering in biological systems.
