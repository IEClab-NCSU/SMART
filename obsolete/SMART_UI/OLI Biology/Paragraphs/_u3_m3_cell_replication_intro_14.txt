The word diploid describes the number of complete chromosome
					sets contained within a cell. Diploid begins with the prefix di, which means two. So diploid means two sets of chromosomes. Each
					cell in a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes, one set from each
					parent. In somatic cells, each newly formed daughter cell needs to have both
					copies of these chromosomes. Mitosis produces identical diploid cells. If
					gametes were diploid, the zygote that results from the fusion of the two gametes
					would have 4 copies of each chromosome. Thatâ€™s too many. Therefore, gametes must
					have only 1 copy of each chromosome: they are haploid. The word haploid
					begins with the letters ha, similar to the word half. This may help you remember
					that haploid cells have half the number of chromosomes of diploid cells, or one
					set of chromosomes.
