Regulation of pathways by altering the amount of enzymes in the pathway is usually too
			slow to meet the second-by-second regulation needs of the organism. Consequently, many
			pathways are regulated by increasing or decreasing the activity of an enzyme due to the
			binding of a small regulatory compound. Typically, only a few steps in the pathway are
			regulated, and the regulated steps typically occur near the beginning of the pathway to
			prevent the accumulation of intermediates, which are seldom of use to the cell. Think of
			an assembly line: the speed of production will change depending on how much of the
			starting material is available, how quickly each of the workers completes the task, and
			how much of the final product is needed. Similarly, pathways are influenced by the
			availability of the starting materials, the activity of each enzyme in the pathway, and
			the concentration of product already present in the cell.
