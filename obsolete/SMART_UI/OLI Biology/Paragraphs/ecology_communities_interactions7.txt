Whenever ecologists study species interactions, they try to get clear data answering
			“what-if” questions. What happens to prey populations if a predator is removed from a
			community, or if a new predator shows up? Do two species really
			compete; that is, do they each do better if they are alone than if they are living
			together in a habitat? Can a species and its mutualist live apart, or are the two
			species entirely dependent on each other? Sometimes we can learn about these issues
			simply by observing what happens when introduced species—species
			brought into an area by human activity—establish themselves in a community. We can also
			see what happens to the larger community if a particular population is eradicated by
			human activity. On a smaller scale, ecologists sometimes carry out true experiments. In
			these studies ecologists deliberately manipulate the presence or abundance of species in
			enclosures or in natural environments and then track what happens to other species as a
			result.
