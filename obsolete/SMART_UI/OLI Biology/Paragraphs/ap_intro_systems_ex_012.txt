Humans take in food, water and oxygen. During digestion and metabolism, food is broken down into simpler substances (including some
            waste products), and some of those simpler substances—for example, simple sugars—can be
            metabolized in a way that they release energy, especially when oxygen is present. The
            products of these processes include solid waste, liquid waste, and carbon dioxide. These
            waste materials must be eliminated from the body to prevent illness. The urinary
                system also helps with removal of wastes being transported in the body
            fluids, but the “exchange” is all internal so it will be explored more in next the vital
            function category.
