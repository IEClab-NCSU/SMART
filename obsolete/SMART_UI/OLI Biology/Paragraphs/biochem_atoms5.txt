Amazingly, however, physicists now understand that most of the volume of an atom is empty
			space. In fact, atoms themselves are made of smaller subatomic particles. We cannot look
			at the parts of atoms with a microscope; they are simply too small. However, physicists
			have learned a great deal about atoms and subatomic particles through more indirect
			methods. One model of the atom that helps us understand chemistry better is shown in the
			diagram below.
