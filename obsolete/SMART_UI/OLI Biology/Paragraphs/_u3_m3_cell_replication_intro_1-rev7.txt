Gametes are haploid cells. They contain only one copy of each
					chromosome. In human haploid gametes, there are 23 chromosomes. One way to write
					this is "1n=23." As you learned in the previous activity, two haploid
					cells can combine, through the process of fertilization, to form a diploid
					zygote. The diploid zygote then goes through mitosis to form the diploid somatic
					cells of the organism.
