After you have generated your synthetic gene, you must insert the gene into an expression
            plasmid so it can be placed inside a living bacterial cell and translated into the HuGH
            protein. We will look at that step in detail on the next page. For now, letâ€™s assume
            that has been accomplished. Here we want to focus on the properties of the expression
            plasmid.
