The acidity of a solution is measured on the pH scale. pH is a
							measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a
							solution. You can think of pH as “parts Hydrogen ion,” but remember that the pH scale is
							“backwards.” The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14,
							with zero being the most acidic (highest concentration of H+)
							and 14 being the most basic. Neutral solutions (like pure water) have a
							pH of 7. Solutions with pH measurements below 7 are acidic, while
							solutions with pH measurement above 7 are basic. A solution at pH 7 is
							neutral because at that pH the number of hydrogen ions (H+)
							equals the number of hydroxide ions (OH-), just as they are
							balanced in pure water.
