Organic macromolecules made up of amino acids connected by peptide
                                bonds. Proteins serve many functions, some of which include:
                                catalyzing reactions as enzymes, storage, replication, transmission,
                                and regulation of genetic information, and helping maintain
                                structure in an organism.
