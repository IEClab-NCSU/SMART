While DNA synthesis could be from either end of the primer, during replication using the
          enzyme DNA polymerase the synthesis is restricted by the enzyme to growth in only one
          direction. Deoxy-nucleotides are only added to the 3’ end of the primer and thus
            synthesis is unidirection from 5’ to 3’.
