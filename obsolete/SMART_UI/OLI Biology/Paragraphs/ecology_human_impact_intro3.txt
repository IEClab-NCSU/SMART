Population size. As we will discuss in this unit,
                Earthâ€™s total human population now exceeds 7 billion. Our total biomass is
                far greater than that of all wild large animals (megafauna) combined, as is
                the biomass of our domestic animals. We require huge volumes of food and
                water simply to meet our most basic needs.
Affluence and consumption levels. Today, over a
                billion humans live in high-income nations where most citizens enjoy a
                standard of living that goes far beyond basic nutrition. Many of us live in
                sturdy temperature-controlled buildings and have indoor plumbing, electric
                lights, washing machines, refrigerators, electronic gadgets, and
                automobiles. These items all require resources and generate wastes in their
                production, use, and disposal.
High-impact technologies. Until about 1800, most human
                activities were accomplished by the labor of humans and domestic animals.
                Biodegradable materials were used. Impacts on ecosystems took a long time to
                develop and much of the damage was repaired through natural processes.
                Today, humans have harnessed outside energy sources (fossil fuels,
                explosives, wind and flowing water, nuclear energy, and the like) to perform
                work at an unprecedented scale. Humans now can rapidly transform landscapes
                and intervene in basic natural processes. Advanced technologies have also
                produced persistent (nonbiodegradable) chemical toxins and radioactive
                wastes.
