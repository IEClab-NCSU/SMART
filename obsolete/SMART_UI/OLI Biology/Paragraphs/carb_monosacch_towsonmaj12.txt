 Similarly, an additional carbon can be added to the pentoses to form the possible
		hexoses (six carbon monosaccharides). An expansive tree on structures can be built
		starting with the simplest aldose. While all of these structures are possible starting
		with D-glyceraldehyde, the biological system only utilizes a few of these structures. Of
		the hexoses, the predominant compound is D-glucose, one of the most prevalent sugars in biology. The linear structure of glucose is shown below, along with ribose.
