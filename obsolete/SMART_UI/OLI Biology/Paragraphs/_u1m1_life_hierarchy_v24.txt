When macromolecules are used as building blocks to form a membrane-bound sphere,
					you have a cell, which is
					the fundamental unit of life. A cell is essentially a tiny droplet of water and
					other molecules enclosed by a fluid “skin” or membrane. The cell is the smallest
					and simplest entity that possesses all the characteristics of life. There are
					two main types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The cells of prokaryotes
					are relatively small and simple; they do not have any clearly defined
					compartments inside of them. The cells of eukaryotes, by contrast, include
					membrane-bound organelles: compartments inside the cell that contain specific
					groups of macromolecules and carry out specific cellular functions. One of these
					organelles is the nucleus; it encloses the DNA within the cell.
