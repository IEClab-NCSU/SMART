In summary, metabolic pathways are dynamic processes, continuously changing in response
			to environmental changes and cellular (or organismal) needs, while avoiding waste of
			resources. How much substrate or enzyme is available will determine the rate of
			reactions. Moreover, extreme “fine-tuning” of metabolism is possible through changes in
			enzyme activity due to the binding of inhibitors. This is a prime example of
			the relationship between structure and function. Underscoring the importance of metabolic regulation, in
			the next module you will learn about medical conditions caused by structural changes in
			enzymes that in turn affects the metabolic pathways they are involved.
