In eukaryotes, the breakdown of sugar begins in the cytoplasm (cytosol), while the consumption of oxygen and the
					generation of CO2 and ATP synthesis happen inside specialized
					membrane-bound organelles called mitochondria. Respiration is
					a complex catabolic  pathway and does not occur in one step.
