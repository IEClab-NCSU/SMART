Although many factors stabilize the final shape of a protein, the most important factor is
					the hydrophobic effect. Amino acids with nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains are
					driven into the central core of the protein because they are repelled by the
					water. This is known as the hydrophobic effect, and it results in proteins that
					have amino acids with hydrophilic side chains on the surface of the protein. The
					folded protein reaches the lowest energy state, which is the most stable, by
					folding in a way that will optimize the burial of nonpolar amino acid side
					chains while still leaving the polar groups on the surface. Therefore, the shape
					of the folded form of the protein depends on the order of the
					hydrophobic amino acids in the protein.
