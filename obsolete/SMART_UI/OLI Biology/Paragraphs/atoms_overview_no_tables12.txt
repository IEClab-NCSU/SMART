As you can see in the table, oxygen, nitrogen, and
					sulfur are electronegative atoms and represent the major electronegative atoms
					in biological molecules. Phosphorous, an important component in nucleic acids
					(e.g. DNA) is also electronegative. Water is a good example of how the very
					electronegative atom of oxygen influences the electrons shared with hydrogen.
					Oxygen has six valence electrons; two sets of paired electrons and two sets of
					single bonding electrons. The shared electron pair of each oxygen-hydrogen
					covalent bond, illustrated below, spends more time associated with the oxygen
					atom than the hydrogen atom. This results in the oxygen being partially
					negative, and the hydrogen partially positive, as indicated in the figure below
					by δ- and δ+. These are then described as a
						polar covalent bonds. The presence of polar covalent bonds in water
					and in other molecules containing electronegative atoms puts these molecules in
					a family of molecules referred to as being polar. We will return to
					polar bonds in water and their consequences in the "Importance of Water"
					section. Oxygen is not the only electronegative element that forms polar bonds,
					as long as the electronegativities of the two atoms differ, the bond will have
					some degree of polar character. For example, the P-O bond in DNA is polar, with
					the phosphorous having a partial positive charge since it is less
					electronegative than oxygen.
