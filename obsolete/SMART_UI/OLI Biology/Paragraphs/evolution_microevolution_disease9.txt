Now that we have learned how our understanding of evolution can be used to help fight
			HIV, letâ€™s see if we can apply that knowledge to an even more complicated infectious
			disease: malaria. Malaria is an ancient disease that has been around for over 50,000
			years! Malaria is caused by four parasites of the Plasmodium
			genus: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium
				ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. These protists (eukaryotes) have complicated
			life-cycles that require both a mosquito host and a human host, and the parasite
			undergoes many developmental stages within these two hosts. Humans become infected with
			the malarial parasites when they are bitten by an infected mosquito. Similarly,
			uninfected mosquitoes can pick up the parasites when they ingest blood from an infected
			human.
