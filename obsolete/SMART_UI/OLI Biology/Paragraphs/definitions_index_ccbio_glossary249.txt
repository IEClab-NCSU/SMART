Molecules containing a carbon atom that is covalently bonded to a
                                hydrogen atom (C-H bonds). Many organic molecules also contain
                                oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. All living organisms are composed of
                                four major classes of large carbon-containing molecules: proteins,
                                carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. The term
                                    organic is in common use these days. For example,
                                you can buy organically grown tomatoes or
                                clothes made from organically grown cotton.
                                In these cases, organic refers to the way the tomatoes
                                and cotton were grown â€” without the use of man-made pesticides or
                                fertilizers, and nurtured only by natural substances. Here, organic
                                is used to denote a natural process. You can see then that the word
                                    organic is used in two different ways. Be careful
                                not to confuse the two. It can also be said that organic
                                    molecules (such as carbon-containing proteins,
                                carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids) are natural molecules. But
                                not all naturally-occurring molecules contain carbon, for example,
                                water and common table salt. Are water and salt naturally occurring?
                                Yes. But are they organic? No, because they are not built from
                                carbon.
