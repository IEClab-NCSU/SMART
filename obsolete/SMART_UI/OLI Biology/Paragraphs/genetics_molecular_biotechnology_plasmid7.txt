The expression plasmid must also contain a promoter that is recognized by RNA
                polymerase. This promoter is adjacent to the growth hormone gene and will enable
                the transcription of the growth hormone gene into mRNA.
The expression plasmid must contain a DNA sequence that allows a repressor protein
                        to bind. The repressor protein can then act as an on-off switch for mRNA
                        production. An on/off switch is important because the production of growth
                        hormone can interfere with cell division and the production of the growth
                        hormone should be off until a sufficient number of cells are obtained. The
                        most common repressor protein that is used is the lac repressor. The lac
                        repressor binds to a specific DNA sequence called the lac operator. You may
                        want to review the properties of the lac
                            operon. The addition of an inducer molecule, such as
                        lactose, will cause the repressor to fall off of the DNA, allowing RNA
                        polymerase to produce mRNA. It is important that the operator sequence is
                        placed between the promoter and the DNA that encodes the mRNA so that mRNA
                        cannot be made unless an inducer is added.
