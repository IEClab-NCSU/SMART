DNA replication relies on the double-stranded nature of the molecule. One
            double stranded DNA molecule, when replicated, will become two double-stranded
            molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. You
            remember that the two strands of DNA run antiparallel: one from the 5’
            to the 3’, and the other from the 3’ to the 5’. The synthesis of the new DNA strand can
            only happen in one direction: from the 5’ to the 3’ end. In other words, the new bases
            are always added to the 3’ end of the newly synthesized DNA strand. So if the new nucleotide is
            always added to the 3’ end of an existing nucleotide, where does the first nucleotide come from? In fact, DNA polymerase needs an
            “anchor” to start adding nucleotides: a short sequence of DNA or RNA that is complementary to the
            template strand will work to provide a free 3’ end. This sequence is called a
                primer.
