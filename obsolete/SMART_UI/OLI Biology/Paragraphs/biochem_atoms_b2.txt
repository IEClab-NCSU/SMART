In addition to location and mass, each subatomic particle has a property called “charge.”
		Charge can be “positive” or “negative.” Items with the same charge tend to repel each
		other and items with opposite charge tend to attract. Protons have a positive charge and
		neutrons have no charge, giving the nucleus a positive overall charge. Each electron has
		a negative charge that is equal in strength to the positive charge of a proton.
		Electrons and the protons of the nucleus attract each other, and this is the force that
		keeps the atom together, much like the force of gravity keeps the moon in orbit around
		Earth.
