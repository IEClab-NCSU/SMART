 Starting with the hemiacetal (closed ring) structure, the unique, newly created,
			asymmetric center has a special name: the anomeric carbon. In the structure of glucose
			given below, the anomeric carbon, which is created by forming the six member
			(pyranose) hemiacetal structure, is highlighted. You should examine this structure and
			convince yourself that the four different substituents attached to that carbon are
unique .
