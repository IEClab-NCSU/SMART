You might be wondering how a single cell can grow into a complex adult organism
					containing many different cell types simply by mitosis. This happens through a
					process known as differentiation, in which certain genes found in a
					cellâ€™s nucleus are turned on or off. Even though every single somatic cell in
					your body contains identical DNA, these cells were able to differentiate into
					specific cell types (such as blood cell, liver cells, etc.) simply by turning
					certain genes on or off. Throughout our lives we continue to produce more
					genetically identical cells through the process of mitosis. These somatic cells
					are essential for growth and replacement of worn-out cells and tissues.
