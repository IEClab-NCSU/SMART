RNA polymerase is an example of a quaternary structure composed of a core protein for the
      synthesis the complementary RNA strand and a subunit, the Sigma subunit, that first binds to
      the promoter region of the Operon and creates an open complex by unwinding the double stranded
      DNA. The promoter region of the operon is critical in defining how much or the frequency with
      which transcription of an operon takes place. Promoters have different sequences. The sigma
      subunit binds to the different promoter sequences with different affinities. In the
      illustration below, the sigma subunit binds to both of the promoters and a dissociation
      constant, Kd, can be written for each binding.
