Previous sections contained an overview of some of the inputs and outputs necessary for
            life as well as a mechanism to deliver them within the body. This section will discuss
            the structures the human body needs to compartmentalize and protect these vital
            components; and, the structures that enable the body to move, obtain nutrients, and avoid
            predators. Organ systems are required to coordinate these many efforts.
