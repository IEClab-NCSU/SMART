Some traits, such as skin color and height, are determined by multiple genes. In
                    humans, skin color is determined by at least three different genes, and probably
                    more. This concept is called polygenic inheritance. Variation along
                    a continuum often indicates that a trait has polygenic inheritance. Most visible
                    traits are polygenic, and their genetic patterns are rather complicated.
