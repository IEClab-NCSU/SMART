In the Stone Age, thinly scattered bands of hunter-gatherers had a limited impact
                    on Earth’s ecosystems. Through the Agricultural Age and particularly during the
                    Industrial Age we’ve seen steep increases in population size, affluence, and the
                    use of high-impact technologies. Human environmental impacts have increased
                    accordingly. Some mechanisms of human impact include physical disturbance of
                    landscapes, depletion of resources, and pollution.
