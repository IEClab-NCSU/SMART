Every day we are bombarded with information about health issues, new vaccines and
					medicines, ecological problems, and other issues related to biological research.
					This information comes at us from a myriad of diverse sources, including
					friends, healthcare providers, the media, your neighbors, and the Internet. As
					you gain a deeper understanding of life and the processes that sustain it, you
					will be able to more effectively sort through and interpret this deluge of
					information, and make informed decisions about your health and how you interact
					with the environment.
