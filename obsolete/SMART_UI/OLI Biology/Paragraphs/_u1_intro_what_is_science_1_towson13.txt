Last, both scientific laws and theories are widely accepted by scientists and change in light of new evidence. This means science and scientific knowledge
                    is tentative but durable. Though reliable and durable, scientific theories and laws are subject to change in light of new data, and thus, are never
                    absolute or static. When new discoveries are made, or additional data are gathered, scientific explanations change to reflect this new knowledge. 
                    Often, new discoveries are made possible by advances in thinking and technology. Despite the tentative nature of science, scientific knowledge is 
                    the most reliable body of knowledge we have about the natural world and how it works.
