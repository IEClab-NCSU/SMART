Notice that the two arrows point in opposite directions. This simply means that
					the equation can move in either direction. In other words, hydrogen ions and
					hydroxide ions can combine to form water, or water can break down into hydrogen
					ions and hydroxide ions. These two reactions are in equilibrium, so at any
					instant in a sample of pure water there are equal concentrations of H+
					 and OH-.
