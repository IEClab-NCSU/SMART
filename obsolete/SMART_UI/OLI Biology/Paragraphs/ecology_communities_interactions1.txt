An interspecific interaction is an effect of one population on
			another in a community. Although we are often focused on how one population affects the
			size of another, ecologists also may look at how species interact in terms of their
			activity, growth rates, body size, or other aspects of their well-being. Interactions
			are classified according to their consequences for each species involved. The most
			important types of interactions are summarized in the table below.
