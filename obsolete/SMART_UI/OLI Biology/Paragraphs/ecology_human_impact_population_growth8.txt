During the Stone Age, for example, human use of fire may have had a profound
                    effect on many ecosystems.By setting forest and grassland fires, humans favor
                    fire-adapted plant and animal species. Hunting may have depleted some food
                    resources and probably contributed to past animal extinctions as well.
