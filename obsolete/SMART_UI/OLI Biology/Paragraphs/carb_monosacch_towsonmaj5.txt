 Examine the glyceraldehyde structure given above and determine which of the carbons has a unique composition of four bonding partners. The number 1 carbon has three bonding partners: an oxygen that is double bonded to the carbon, a hydrogen, and the remainder of the structure. The number 2 carbon has an aldehyde, a hydrogen, a hydroxyl group and the rest of the molecule attached, while the number three carbon has a hydroxyl, two hydrogens and the upper portion of the molecule attached. The number 2 carbon isthe only carbon that has its four bonds involved with four different groups and, thus, is a unique carbon identified as a chiral or asymmetric center. Based on the fact that this chiral carbon has tetrahedral bonding structure, it can  form structural enantiomers.
