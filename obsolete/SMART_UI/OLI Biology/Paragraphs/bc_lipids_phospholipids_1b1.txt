Remember that hydrophilic
			molecules dissolve in water and hydrophobic ones do not. But phospholipids have a “split personality” in
			this regard. How do they behave in water? When small numbers of phospholipids are in an
			aqueous solution they will self-assemble into micelles, structures that exclude water
			molecules from the hydrophobic tails while keeping the hydrophilic head in contact with
			the aqueous solution. If enough phospholipids are present, they will form a bilayer.
			This is the favored formation because it is the most stable orientation for
			phospholipids in a water solution. View the animation that demonstrates the formation of
			micelles and bilayers.
