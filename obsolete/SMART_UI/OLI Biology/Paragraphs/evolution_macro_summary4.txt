Macroevolutionary thinking can be helpful in many practical ways. It can help us deal
            more intelligently with diverse life forms: organisms within a clade are similar and
            we can predict a lot about a species if we can map it to a particular group. This
            comes in handy when we face a new threat or when we are searching for species with
            helpful characteristics. We can also learn about ourselves
            by studying model organisms as different as yeast, worms, and mice. If lifeâ€™s
            diversity were not linked by ancestry, each new species
            would be as unfamiliar and mysterious to us as an alien from another galaxy. Indeed,
            we would be aliens on a planet full of alien life forms. Instead, we are surrounded
            by - and part of - a great extended family of life.
