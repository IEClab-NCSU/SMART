Just as with proteins, a DNA (or RNA) strand has directionality: one end is
					different than the other. In the case of proteins, an amino group is found on
					one end and a carboxylate group is found on the other end. Since it is the order
					of bases that carries out the
						function of DNA (information storage), we often represent
					DNA as just a sequence of bases (GAGGCT) and do not bother representing the
					backbone. By convention, the first letter is the base at the 5’ (five prime) end
					of the DNA strand. Thus, the sequence GAGGCT is shorthand for 5’-GAGGCT-3’.
