The DNA sequences that are recognized by restriction endonucleases have a unique property
            in that the sequence on the top strand is identical to the sequence on the bottom
            strand, i.e. in the case of EcoR1 the sequence of the top strand is 5’-GAATTC. Taking
            the complement of that sequence to generate the bottom strand gives: 5’ GAATTC. The
            other notable feature is that the cutting position is in the same location on both
            strands. Using EcoR1 as an example, the enzyme cuts between the G and the A. The
            symmetry in the recognition sequence and the cutting location is due to the fact that
            the active form of these enzymes contain two identical polypeptide chains. You can
            imagine that one chain recognizes and cleaves the top strand. The second chain, because
            it is identical to the first, recognizes the same sequence on the other strand and
            cleaves in the same location.
