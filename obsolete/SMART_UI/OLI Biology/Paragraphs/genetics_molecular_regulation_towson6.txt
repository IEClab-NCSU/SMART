It is less efficient for bacteria to use lactose as an energy source because they
                    must take additional steps to convert lactose into a form that can be used to
                    extract energy. Each of these steps requires the synthesis of an enzyme, which
                    is costly to the bacteria. Consequently, bacteria prefer to use glucose rather
                    than lactose as a fuel source when both sugars are present. However, when
                    lactose is present and glucose is not, the bacteria “turn on,” or synthesize,
                    the enzymes required for lactose metabolism, allowing the bacteria to use
                    lactose for energy.
