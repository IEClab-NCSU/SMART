Why does macroevolution matter? Is it just ancient history? Far from it! “Tree thinking”
            is basic to progress in modern biology. It helps us deal with the vast diversity of life
            in an organized fashion. We don’t have to start from “square one” with each species of
            interest. Instead, we can use natural groupings (clades) to our advantage.
