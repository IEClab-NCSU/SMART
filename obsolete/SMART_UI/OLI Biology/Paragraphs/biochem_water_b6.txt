Polar molecules also are hydrophilic. Polar water molecules readily
			surround and dissolve polar molecules or molecules with polar functional groups.
			Examples include sugars and alcohols, which have hydroxyl groups. Molecules that do not
			dissolve in water are 
				hydrophobic (from the Greek word meaning water-fearing or water-hating). Nonpolar molecules are
			hydrophobic. Examples include hydrocarbons and fatty acids with their abundant nonpolar
			C-H bonds. Have you ever tried to mix water and oil? Oils and fats are nonpolar and will
			not form a solution with water.
