Carbon, for example, has an atomic number of 6 (see the figure below). The outer shell of
			carbon has 4 electrons. Carbon can share an electron with four other atoms. Hydrogen has
			an atomic number of 1. It has a single electron in its outermost shell, and can share
			this electron with one other atom. A carbon atom can form a covalent bond with four
			hydrogen atoms to form a molecule called methane, CH4 . In a
			methane molecule, carbon effectively has a “full” second shell (8 electrons) and each
			hydrogen has a “full” second shell (two electrons).
