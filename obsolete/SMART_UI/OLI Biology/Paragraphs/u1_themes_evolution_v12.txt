As you learned previously in this module, reproduction results in the passing of
                    characteristics from parents to offspring and maintains the continuity of life.
                    You can see this in a family photograph: offspring resemble their parents and
                    siblings resemble each other. Biologists look at all life on the planet and see
                    the same patterns.
