To decrease the pH inside the lysosome, the concentration of protons will need to be greater
			inside the lysosome than in the cytoplasm. To accomplish this,
				protons will need to move from a low concentration to a high
			concentration. This is a nonspontaneous process and requires the cell to do work to move
			the ions "uphill" against the concentration gradient. To do work, the cell must expend
			energy and actively move (pump) the ions. This process is referred to as
					active transport. The source of energy for this process in
			most biological systems is the hydrolysis of ATP.
