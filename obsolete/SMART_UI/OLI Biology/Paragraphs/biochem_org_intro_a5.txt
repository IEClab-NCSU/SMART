All organic molecules contain carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen (C-H bonds).
						Organic molecules often contain oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur as
						well.
Atoms
						within organic molecules are connected by covalent bonds.
Organic molecules are modular. Smaller organic molecules
							(monomers) can be linked together to make larger organic
						molecules (polymers). Larger organic molecules consist of a
						carbon/oxygen/nitrogen/phosphorus skeleton (backbone) with other atoms
						branching off from this structure. 
Organic molecules are typically produced by living cells and are found in
						large amounts only in living things or in their remains. However, it is
						important to remember that some molecules produced by living things are
						inorganic. Humans have developed ways to synthesize organic chemicals
						artificially.
