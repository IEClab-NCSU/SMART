 You will study 
							metabolism in this course. Metabolism will draw
							upon your understanding of chemistry: cells use chemical nutrients and
							chemical energy sources. You will also need to use your understanding of
							cells: there are certain parts of the cell whose role is to break down
							nutrients, build new material, and manage the energy needs of the cell.
							Every living organism undergoes metabolism, so it is a crucial concept
							in biology. This figure demonstrates one metabolic pathway: a series of
							chemical reactions that starts the process of breaking down sugar for
							use as fuel in a cell.
