Shown below is a different cell with the same extracellular concentrations of solute
						as the cell in the previous question. This cell has a channel instead of a carrier
						protein to transport the molecule. This Carrier Protein Rate Curve depicts the relationship 
						between the rate of transport and solute concentration we would expect for a carrier protein.
