This module explored the application of inheritance patterns to human
                    characteristics and hereditary disorders. Many human conditions follow the
                    Mendelian pattern, with a recessive allele being responsible for the diseased
                    phenotype most of the time. In other cases, there may be a linkage of genes to a
                    sex chromosome, most commonly the X chromosome. The traits for those genes are
                    called sex-linked traits, and they were originally described by Morgan in his
                    classical fruit fly experiments.
