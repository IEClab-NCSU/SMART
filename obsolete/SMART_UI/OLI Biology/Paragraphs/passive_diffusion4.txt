Of the first two types of molecules, the first type might include a molecule such as
			cholesterol which has some solubility in water but is highly soluble in the non-polar
			environment of the lipid bilayer and thus will freely pass into the  hydrophobic
			environment of the membrane, distribute freely in the membrane and then some fraction
			will dissolve in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. A second example of this type
			of permeable molecule is water which while polar is small and able to freely pass across
			the membrane. The lipid bilayer is much less permeable to the second type of molecule
			indicating a more polar character and a larger size. Examples of such molecules are the
			sodium and chloride ions. As a general rule, charged molecules are much less permeable
			to the lipid bilayer. The third type of molecule is the very polar, in many cases
			charged, and usually larger molecule. Examples are carbohydrates and amino acids.
