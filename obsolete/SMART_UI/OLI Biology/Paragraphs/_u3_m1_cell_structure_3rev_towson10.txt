Plant cells have an additional type of organelle —
									chloroplasts, which exist only in plant
							cells — involved in energy transfer. The chloroplasts provide sugar.
							Chloroplasts capture energy from the sun and use that energy to build
							sugar molecules. Mitochondria then harvest the
							energy stored in the sugar molecules and use it to do work. The
							chloroplasts and mitochondria are the organelles responsible for
							providing energy for all cellular functions.
