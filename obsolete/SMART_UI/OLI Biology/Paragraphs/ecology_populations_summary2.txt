If a population is closed (no immigration or emigration), it will change at a
                    rate that is determined by the balance between births and deaths: the per capita
                    rate of change = per capita birth rate - per capita death rate. If conditions
                    are ideal, all populations have the tendency to increase, with the birth rate
                    exceeding the death rate. Exponential growth is a pattern of increase in which
                    the per capita rate of increase is constant and positive. As a result, the
                    population grows faster the larger it gets. A graph of exponential growth
                    resembles a J-shaped curve. For a short time, real populations can show bursts
                    of growth that fit predictions of the exponential model. However, many different
                    factors influence real populations and cause their numbers to vary over time in
                    a somewhat unpredictable way.
