In most multicellular organisms, cells combine to make tissues, groups of similar cells carrying out the same detailed
						function. Organs are collections of tissues grouped
					together based on a common general function. Organs are present not only in
					higher level animals but also in plants. An organ system
					is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related
					organs. Mammals have many organ systems, an example of which is the circulatory
					system that transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it
					includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms
					are individual living entities that survive and reproduce as a unit. For
					example, each tree in a forest is usually an individual organism. Single-celled
					life forms are also considered to be organisms and are typically referred to as
						microorganisms.
