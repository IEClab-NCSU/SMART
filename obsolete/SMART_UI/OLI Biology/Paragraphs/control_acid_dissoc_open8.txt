Understanding the reverse titration, the addition of a strong acid to a
							solution of conjugate base follows the same logic. At high pH, the added
							protons do not protonate the weak acid since the pH is much higher than
							the pKa. In the buffer region of pH = pKa+/-1, the
							protons that are added to the solution will not decrease the pH, instead
							they will convert some of the conjugate base, A-, to the acid
							form, HA. At the lower edge of the buffer region the weak acid is almost
							fully protonated (pH=pKa-1), consequently it cannot absorb
							any additional protons.
