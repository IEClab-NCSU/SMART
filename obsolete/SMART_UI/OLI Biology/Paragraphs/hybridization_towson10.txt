The nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids absorb UV light at 260nm. Using this
        characteristic it is possible to measure the concentration of DNA in a solution using
        spectrophotometry (measuring the amount of light of a specific wavelength of light
        absorbed by a solution). The absorbance values depend, in part, on the DNA structure
        because single stranded DNA will absorb less light than double stranded DNA.
