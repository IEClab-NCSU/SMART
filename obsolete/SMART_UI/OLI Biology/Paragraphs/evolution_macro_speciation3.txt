What could break up a biological lineage? Species can form if they are isolated from the
            source lineage by geography. This is called allopatric speciation.
            Allopatric translates to “different country.” Species may also form through genetic or
            other changes that create a subgroup within a lineage that does not breed or exchange
            individuals with the source population. A new species “pops up” right within, and
            surrounded by, its parent species. This is called sympatric
                speciation (translates to “same-country”).
