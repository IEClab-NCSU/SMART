The expression plasmid must also contain a section of DNA that encodes a protein
                that will confer antibiotic resistance on the bacterial cells that contain the
                plasmid. This provides a method to select the bacterial cells that contain the
                plasmid, because if they have the plasmid, they will be able to grow in the presence
                of an antibiotic while cells that do not have the plasmid will die.
