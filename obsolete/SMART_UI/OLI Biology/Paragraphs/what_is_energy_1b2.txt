Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Instead, energy is transformed from one form to
					another. Imagine that you climb a mountain trail ending in a steep cliff. Your
					body’s movement (kinetic energy) is fueled by chemical energy from your food. As
					you move uphill, your body’s chemical potential energy decreases (you break down
					molecules and use up stored food energy). At the same time, your body’s gravitational potential energy increases. This kind of potential energy can be released by letting an
					object drop from a height. A fall from the top of the cliff would do a great
					deal of “work,” so watch your step!
