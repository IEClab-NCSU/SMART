In general endocytosis, a molecule or particle encounters the cell surface and randomly
			causes the membrane to create first a pit in the membrane, followed by a further
			invagination of the plasma membrane and finally the pinching off of the plasma membrane
			around the molecule or particle resulting in the formation of a vesicle in the cytoplasm
			of the cell. Note that during the process the asymmetry of the membrane would be
			apparent by the fact that the inside surface of the newly formed vesicle is the same as
			the exterior of the cell. Thus the integrity of the cytoplasm and its exposure to only
			the inside surface of the membrane is preserved. Exocytosis is just the reverse
			of this process with the fusion of an internal vesicle with the plasma membrane thus
			releasing its content to the outside. The balance of exocytosis and endocytosis
			preserves the size of the plasma membrane and ensure neither growth nor shrinking of the
			cell size.
