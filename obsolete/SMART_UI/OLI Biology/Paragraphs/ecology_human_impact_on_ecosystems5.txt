Energy enters the Earth system—its land, water, and air—as sunlight. Some of the
                    light is reflected back into space, but much of it is absorbed by land and
                    water. When materials absorb light, they warm up. Over time, they release energy
                    as heat, also known as infrared radiation. Eventually, all of the energy that
                    entered as sunlight escapes back into space as infrared radiation. Energy that
                    enters the Earth system as light is balanced by energy that exits as heat.
