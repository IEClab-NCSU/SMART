In contrast to the extreme variability of the outside world, the interior of a cell is a
            remarkably constant environment. For example, cells typically keep their internal pH
            (acidity) within a narrow range. This is important because changes in pH can cause
            molecules like enzymes to change their shapes. As you already know, a moleculeâ€™s shape
            (or structure) determines its function. If its shape changes, it may lose function.
            Because of this, many of the chemical reactions of life will not work properly if cell
            conditions change too much.
