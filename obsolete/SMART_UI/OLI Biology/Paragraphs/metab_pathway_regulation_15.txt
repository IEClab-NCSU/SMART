Letâ€™s look at an example of a metabolic pathway and explore one mechanism that
				regulates it. You may remember that cellular respiration is an essential
					catabolic
					pathway. Cellular respiration starts with a pathway called
					glycolysis, which degrades three-carbon glucose into a three-carbon
				molecule called pyruvate. Glucose can come from ingested carbohydrates,
				or from degradation of glycogen, a polysaccharide. When there is an excess of
				carbohydrates, they are stored as glycogen in an anabolic pathway.
