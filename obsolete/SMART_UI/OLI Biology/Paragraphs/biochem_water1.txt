Have you ever wondered why scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? It is
			because, at least here on Earth, water is essential to life. Evidence of water on Mars,
			and some of the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, increases the odds that life may exist
			there. Here on Earth, water is one of the most abundant molecules. The water content of
			our bodies and our cells ranges from 70 to 95 percent. All of lifeâ€™s chemical reactions
			take place in watery fluid. Without water, life as we know it simply would not
			exist.
