Think of a population as a parade of generations, with each new crop of offspring
			replacing the previous generation. For sexual species, the average female must produce
				two offspring that live to reproduce: one to replace
			herself, and another to replace her mate. Yet we know that most species attempt to
			produce more—often far more—than one or two offspring. Furthermore, they often attempt
			to live for several reproductive seasons, each time generating another set of offspring.
			As long as conditions permit good survival and successful reproduction, any population’s
			size will inevitably increase.
