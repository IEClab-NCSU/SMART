All DNA found in living organisms comes in sets of two polymers or strands, usually referred to
			as double-stranded DNA. Some viruses are an exception to this rule and contain
			single-stranded DNA as their genetic material. The discovery that DNA structure is a
			double helix (two strands wound around each other) is considered one of the greatest
			discoveries in science. Understanding of the structure of DNA opened up a whole new
			realm of biological and biomedical research (molecular biology) and led to the
			development of new technologies in science and medicine. Letâ€™s examine the structure of
			DNA using the activity below.
