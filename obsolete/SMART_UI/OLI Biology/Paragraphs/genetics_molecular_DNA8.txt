The order of nucleotides in a gene (in DNA) is the key to how information is stored.
                For example, consider these two words: stable and tables. Both words are built from
                the same letters (subunits), but the different order of these subunits results in
                very different meanings. In DNA, the information is stored in units of 3 letters.
                Use the following key to decode the encrypted message. This should help you to see
                how information can be stored in the linear order of nucleotides in DNA.
