 The 
urinary


system doesnâ€™t take in anything from the environment, but does
                    eliminate waste products of metabolism from the body fluid. However, this is
                    just one of several roles that the urinary system plays in maintaining
                    homeostasis of body fluids, so it will be explored more extensively in the next
                    vital function category involving body fluids.
