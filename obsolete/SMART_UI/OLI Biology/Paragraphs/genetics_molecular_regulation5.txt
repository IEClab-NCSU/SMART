The genes for lactose metabolism are contained in an operon known as the lac operon. The lac operon is controlled by the lac
                    repressor, which is produced from the lacI gene. The lacI gene has its own
                    promoter; consequently, low levels of the lac repressor protein are present all
                    of the time. Three structural genes in the operon, lacZ, lacY, and lacA, encode
                    enzymes required for lactose metabolism.
