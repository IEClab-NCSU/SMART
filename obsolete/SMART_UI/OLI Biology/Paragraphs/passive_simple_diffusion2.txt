The introduction of a cell or liposome into the solution places a barrier to the molecules.
			As three different molecules diffuse to equilibrium they encounter the lipid bilayer
			depicted by the horizontal membrane across the center of the stage in the following
			animation. Note that one type of molecule passes freely through the lipid bilayer while
			the second type of molecule only occasionally passes through the membrane and the lipid
			bilayer is totally impermeable to the third type of molecule.
