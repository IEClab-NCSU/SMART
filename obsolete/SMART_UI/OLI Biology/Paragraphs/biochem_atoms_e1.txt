Scientists have learned to use isotopes in many different ways. For example, stable isotopes can be used to
			trace chemical reactions through a food web. For example, if a stable isotope is used in
			fertilizer, that same isotope will later show up in the tissues of plants, then in
			animals, and finally in decomposers as the nutrient moves through the food web. Other
			isotopes are unstable and they tend to decay (or break down into other isotopes) at a
			constant rate. Scientists have learned how to use unstable isotopes to determine the age
			of fossils or artifacts. Finally, some isotopes are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes
			emit energy in the form of radiation when they decay into different isotopes.
