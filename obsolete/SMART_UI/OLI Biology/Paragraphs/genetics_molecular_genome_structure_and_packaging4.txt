Plasmids provide a very useful tool for biotechnology. Scientists use them to insert
            “foreign” genes into bacteria so they can use the bacteria as “factories” to produce
            desired proteins. For example, to study a human disease caused by a malfunction in a
            specific protein, scientists need a large amount of the protein for experiments. Instead
            of purifying protein from human cells, scientists can combine coding DNA from the human
            genome with bacterial regulatory DNA regions on a plasmid, and introduce the plasmid
            carrying human gene into the bacteria. Growing a large amount of bacterial cells is much
            easier than obtaining large amounts of human cells. Combining DNA from different
            organisms is called recombinant DNA technology.
