The products of transcription, rRNA, tRNA and mRNA, are each used for different functions
      within the cell but are all essential to protein synthesis. They each also undergo change or
      modification before they are used to carry out their specific function. This process of change
      after transcription from DNA to RNA is called post-transcriptional modification.
