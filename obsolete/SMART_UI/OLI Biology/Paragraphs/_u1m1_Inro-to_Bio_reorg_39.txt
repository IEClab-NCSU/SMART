The hierarchical organization of living systems continues beyond single
					organisms. A population consists of all the individuals
					of the same kind living within a specific area. For example, a forest may
					include many pine trees. All those pine trees represent the population of pine
					trees in this forest. Many different populations living in the same area
					together form a community. Continuing with the case in
					point, the forest with pine trees includes populations of flowers, mammals,
					birds, insects, fungi, and bacteria, all of which can interact. These
					interacting populations make up a community. An ecosystem
					consists of all the living things in an area plus the abiotic or non-living
					parts of that environment. The pine forest ecosystem includes not just plants,
					animals, and microorganisms but also rocks, water, temperature changes, air
					chemistry, and other abiotic factors that interact with living organisms in the
					area. Finally, the highest level of organization in living systems is the biosphere, which is the collection of all ecosystems on
					Earth. The biosphere includes all habitable zones on the Earth, including water
					and ice; land, soil, and rocks to a great depth in the Earthâ€™s crust; and the
					atmosphere to great height.
