            After all, the professor asked for a paper on phylogenetic biology, so of course the
            papers will be similar! The professor counters this with a quick calculation: the odds
            that two studentsâ€™ papers would have such similar language by
            chance are one in several trillion. The academic integrity board agrees: either one
            student copied from the other, or they both copied language from the same outside
            source.
