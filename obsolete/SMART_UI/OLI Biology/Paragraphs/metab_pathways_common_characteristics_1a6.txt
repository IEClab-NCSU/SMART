Many metabolic pathways are reversible,
					which means that certain chemical reactions can go “either way,” depending on
					the needs of the cell. For example, some of the reactions that are part of
					cellular respiration (which is a catabolic pathway) can become anabolic when
					there is a surplus of energy. A small number of steps utilize different enzymes
					in the forward versus the reverse direction. These enzymes are regulated in a
					coordinated fashion such that a pathway operates in only direction at time.
