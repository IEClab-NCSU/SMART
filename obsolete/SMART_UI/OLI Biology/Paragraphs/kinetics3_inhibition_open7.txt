The pH of the environment a protein finds itself in can drastically affect the
					proteins function and denaturation state. Have you ever put lemon and cream into
					hot tea at the same time? The cream curdles because the low pH of the lemon
					juice causes the proteins to denature. pH also affects the ability of a protein
					to bind to its ligand. At low pH hydrogen bond acceptors such as carboxyl groups
					become protonated. If they are protonated then they cannot form the critical
					ionic bonds between the protein and the ligand. The graph below shows the
					activity of a typical protein as a function of pH. This protein is most active
					around neutral pH.
