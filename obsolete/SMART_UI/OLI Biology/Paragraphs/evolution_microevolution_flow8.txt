The alleles and genotypes in a gene pool can also change via two
			processes that are sometimes confused with one another: gene flow
			and genetic drift. Gene flow refers
			to the movement of alleles from one population to another, as a result of migration
			followed by breeding. Remember that when living organisms move from one place to
			another, they take their alleles with them! Consider the average height difference
			between people in East Asia (e.g. China) and those in Western nations (Europe and the
			Americas). As westerners migrate to East Asia, the gene pool there changes to include
			more alleles that confer tall height. Conversely, alleles characteristic of Asian
			populations move along with immigrants to the United States. Gene flow involves breeding
			between two or more populations and it tends to make them more similar to each
			other.
