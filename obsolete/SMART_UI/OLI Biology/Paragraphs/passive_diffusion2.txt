Both large and small molecules follow the same general principal of diffusion. Molecules
			spontaneously move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
			following Brownian motion. The classic example is the diffusion of a drop of ink placed
			in a beaker of water. The concentrated drop of color slowly disperses (diffuses) until
			at some point equilibrium is reached in which the beaker appears to have a uniform
			color. The following animation depicts this simple diffusion process.
