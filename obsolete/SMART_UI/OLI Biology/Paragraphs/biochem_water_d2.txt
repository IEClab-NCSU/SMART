When water is heated, a large part of the heat energy goes into breaking the
					hydrogen bonds between the water molecules. Only a small part actually increases
					the kinetic energy of the water molecules. Imagine a rack of billiard (pool)
					balls. When the cue ball strikes them, energy is transferred and the balls
					“break,” rolling in every direction. What would happen if the balls were
					connected by rubber bands? They would not move nearly as much. Similarly, the
					hydrogen bonds among water molecules make it hard to increase their “jiggling.”
					As heat is added, hydrogen bonds are broken and water warms up, but due to the
					hydrogen bonding, the water’s temperature changes only slowly. When water cools
					down, it releases a great deal of heat as hydrogen bonds are re-established.
					This effect is particularly strong when water freezes; water molecules are
					joined in a regular crystal structure by stable hydrogen bonds. As these bonds
					form, heat is released to the surrounding environment. You may have noticed that
					snowy days are often not quite as cold as the dry clear days of winter. This is
					yet another example of the way that water moderates temperature.
