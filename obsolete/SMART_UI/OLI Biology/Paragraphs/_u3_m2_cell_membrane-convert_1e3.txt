Archaeans are often found living in extreme environments such as high
					temperature, pH, or salinity, and as such, are often called “extremophiles”
					(loving extreme conditions). How can their cell membranes stay intact in such
					conditions? The cell membrane must have a unique structure to withstand these
					conditions.
