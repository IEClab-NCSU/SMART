Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus (center) of the atom. Electrons are found
		outside of the nucleus, in zones that are called “shells.” The mass of an atom is called
		the “atomic mass”. When calculating atomic mass, we pay attention only to the protons
		and neutrons; the electrons have almost no mass. Each of the heavy particles (neutron,
		proton) weighs one atomic mass unit, so a Helium atom (two protons, two neutrons, and
		two electrons) weighs about four atomic mass units.
