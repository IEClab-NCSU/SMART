An important force in biochemistry is due to van der Waals interactions.
					This interaction occurs between any two surfaces that are in contact. The force
					is actually an electrostatic one that occurs as a result of a momentary
					fluctuation in the charge on one surface.. This charge causes the other surface
					to momentarily assume the opposite charge, leading to a net attractive force. If
					one of the surfaces has a permanent dipole, due to the presence of
					electronegative or electropositive atoms, then the attraction is stronger. The
					strength of van der Waals forces depend on the contact surface area; the larger
					the area the larger the interaction. At the molecular level, van der Waals
					interactions can contribute 10s of kJ/mol of energy. At the macroscopic level
					van der Waals forces can become quite large. For example, the common gecko
					generates sufficient van der Waals forces due to the large surface area of its
					foot pads to walk on the ceiling!
