A catalyst is a participant in a chemical reaction that speeds up the
                        reaction but is not consumed itself. Enzymes are biological catalysts that
                        mediate the conversion of substrate to product, by lowering the activation
                        energy of the reaction. Enzymes are not consumed or modified during the
                        process. Enzymes are generally made of proteins but nucleic acid enzymes,
                        ribozymes, have also been discovered.  Refer to page.
