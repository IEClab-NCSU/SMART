 To keep their membranes fluid across a range of temperatures, cells alter the
					composition of their membranes. Phospholipids with differing fatty
					acid tails have different levels of mobility in the membrane. The right ratio of
						saturated to unsaturated fatty acids keeps the
					membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life. For example, winter wheat
					responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing the amount of unsaturated
					fatty acids in cell membranes. The unsaturated fatty acid tails keep membranes
					fluid because they are kinked and resistant to packing. In animal cells, the
					membrane is made up of mostly saturated fatty acids, so it is relatively stable
					(not too fluid). Cholesterol plays a key role in keeping animal
					cell membranes fluid across a range of temperatures. At high temperatures,
					cholesterol molecules interfere with phospholipid movement and reduce membrane
					fluidity. At low temperatures, cholesterol keeps the saturated fatty acid tails
					from packing and maintains adequate fluidity. Other sterols play a similar role
					in the cell membranes of plants, fungi, and even some prokaryotes. Fungi, for example, use ergosterol.
