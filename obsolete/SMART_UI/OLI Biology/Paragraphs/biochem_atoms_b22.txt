The mass of an atom is called the atomic mass. When
			calculating atomic mass, we pay attention only to the protons and neutrons; the
			electrons have almost no mass. The atomic mass is the sum of the number of protons
			and the number of neutrons. By summing the atomic mass of all the atoms in a molecule,
			one can estimate the molecular mass of the molecule, which is expressed in atomic mass
			units (called Daltons). Each of the heavy particles (neutron,
			proton) weighs one atomic mass unit, so a Helium (He) atom, which has two protons, two
			neutrons, and two electrons, weighs about four atomic mass units; that is, two protons
			plus two neutrons.
