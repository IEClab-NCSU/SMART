Each new cell gets one of these nuclei during the process of
						cytokinesis. At the end of mitosis and
					cytokinesis, each new daughter cell should have the identical
					genetic makeup of the parent cell. Mitosis of a single diploid cell will result in
					two diploid cells with identical genomes, unless a mutation or other error
					occurred. Mitosis of a haploid cell will result in
					two identical haploid cells. These cells can go through the process again to
					reproduce.
