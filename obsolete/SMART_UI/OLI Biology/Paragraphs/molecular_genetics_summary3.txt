The knowledge of molecular genetics can be applied to medicine. One application discussed
            in the Biotechnology module involves production of human proteins in bacterial, yeast or
            other cells grown in laboratory. Since genetic code is nearly universal, DNA from humans
            can be “read” by other cells and used to make proteins. However, differences in gene and
            genome structure between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells require scientists to engineer
            new DNA molecules that combine both, coding information from a human gene and regulatory
            information from yeast or bacterial genomes. A large number of techniques have been
            developed for manipulating DNA: PCR is used to make copies of DNA fragments, specialized
            enzymes are used to cut and put together DNA fragments, and special procedures drive
            foreign DNA into the cells and induce expression of the foreign gene.
