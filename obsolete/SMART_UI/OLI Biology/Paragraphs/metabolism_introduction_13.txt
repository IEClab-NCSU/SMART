Metabolic pathways are either anabolic or catabolic. Anabolic pathways involve the use of
			energy and simple organic building blocks to create more complex molecules. Catabolic
			pathways convert complex molecules to simpler ones, releasing energy for use by the
			organism. You will learn about the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways â€œ
			in a  Anabolic and Catabolic Reactions
