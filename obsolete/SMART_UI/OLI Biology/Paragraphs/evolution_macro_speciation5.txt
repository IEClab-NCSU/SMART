Allopatric speciation can occur in another way as well: through long-distance dispersal
            and colonization of a new habitat. We can see the result of this process in islands far
            out at sea: a few hardy colonists “make it” to an island to start a population; after
            many generations they are distinct from their cousins on the mainland. This mechanism is
            illustrated in the diagram below:
