Scientific and non-scientific views are separate but potentially complementary ways of
            knowing. Scientific methods can be used to answer direct, factual questions about “what
            is” and “what probably was” through a clear procedure of observation and testing.
            Through an ongoing process scientists select ideas that best fit the available data. No
            religious tradition revealed the existence and function of DNA to humans: that was the
            fruit of scientific study and reasoning. However, answers derived from science are
            limited. They do not necessarily help with ultimate questions of meaning (why the
            Universe exists in the first place, what humans should be or do). Non-scientific ways of
            looking at the world (religion, philosophy) are more directly focused on these
            questions. Many scientists embrace religious ideas about the meaning and ultimate
            origins of life. However, they do not publish these ideas in scientific journals or used
            them to explain their detailed observations of the natural world.
