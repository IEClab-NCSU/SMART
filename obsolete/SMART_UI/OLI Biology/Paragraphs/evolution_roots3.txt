In this course, we will focus on how the scientific community understands evolution and
            the origins of life. Like the community of science itself, we will restrict our scope to
            fairly narrow questions of how and when things probably happened, based on what we can
            observe today. Other explanations are better suited to philosophy or religion courses;
            they help us explore broader questions about why the Universe exists and what our place
            is within it.
