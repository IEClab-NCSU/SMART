Steroids are a family of lipids based on a molecular structure with four fused carbon rings.
			This family of lipids includes many hormones and cholesterol. Hormones (such as estrogen
			and testosterone) are used by some animals as long-distance messengers. This means that
			they are produced by cells in one part of the body and affect cells in a different part
			of the body.
