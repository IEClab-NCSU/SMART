In this module, you will learn about how genetic information is stored in DNA and copied
            for the next generation. You will also look at a practical application of the process of
            DNA replication called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the next module, you will
            learn how the genetic information stored in genes is expressed, resulting in the variety
            of traits and phenotypes of all organisms.
