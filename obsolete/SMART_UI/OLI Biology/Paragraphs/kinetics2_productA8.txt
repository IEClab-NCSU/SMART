Enzyme catalysis is affected by many factors including substrate and
					enzyme concentrations, pH, temperature, and the presence of inhibitors.
					The learn-by-doing on this page will explore the effect of substrate
					concentration.  The following page will explore the effect of enzyme
					concentration, pH, temperature, and inhibitors on the velocity of the
					enzyme catalyzed reaction.
