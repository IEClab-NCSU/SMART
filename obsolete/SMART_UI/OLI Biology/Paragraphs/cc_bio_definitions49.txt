Humans move species out of their natural range and into a new area.  The new species prey upon, compete with, change habitat for, or otherwise harm native species, resulting in their extinction.  This is a particularly important threat on islands and other isolated habitats, where introduced predators may decimate native prey species that are not adapted to their presence.
