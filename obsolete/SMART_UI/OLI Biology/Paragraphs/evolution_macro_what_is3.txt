As you should recall, microevolution occurs at the population level. But a population is
            only a part of a larger collection that we refer to here as a biological lineage. A lineage is a group of populations that evolves
            independently of other groups. Members of the same lineage can move between its
            populations. Mating may occur between members of different populations in the same
            lineage. Lineages change as their member populations evolve and exchange genes and
            individuals with each other. To get a clearer sense for the nature of a biological
            lineage, do the Learn By Doing activity below.
