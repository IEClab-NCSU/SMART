 As described previously the aldehyde form of aldoses and ketone form of ketoses
			spontaneously form five and six member ring structures called furanoses and pyranoses
			respectively. This ring closure was an example of an alcohol functional group reacting
			with the carbon of the carbonyl functional group in either the aldehyde (aldose) or
			ketone (ketose) group. This is illustrated below. Notice that while atoms are moving
			from place to place on the structure, there is no net gain or loss of atoms in the
			closing of the ring to form what is referred to as a hemiacetal. Furthermore,
			this ring closure is freely reversible, which allows the alpha form of the ring to be in
			equilibrium with the beta form.
