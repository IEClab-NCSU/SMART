The tendency of an atom to attract electrons to itself. Electronegativity
                        increases as one moves from left to right, across the periodic chart.
                        Because the electronegative atoms have the potential to attract electrons,
                        i.e., the electrons spend more time on the electronegative atom, a molecule
                        containing an electronegative atom will have partial negative charge
                        associated with that atom (as indicated by δ-). The the
                        bonding partner in the covalent bond becomes partially positively charged
                        (as indicated by δ+ ).  Refer to page.
