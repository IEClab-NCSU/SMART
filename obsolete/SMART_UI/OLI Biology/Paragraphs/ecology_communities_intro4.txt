An ecological community can be described in many different ways. One statistic that is
			often of interest is the species richness of a community: the
			number of different species of organisms present in a given area. Some communities, such
			as tropical rainforest or coral reef communities, have high species richness with
			thousands of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms coexisting in a small area.
			Other communities with harsher conditions (deserts, arctic tundra, salt lakes) may hold
			far fewer species. Within any region, a given type of habitat will have a fairly
			predictable level of species richness. Human activities that alter living conditions,
			such as pollution or habitat destruction, can change the membership of communities and
			usually will cause species richness to drop. Thus a naturally high level of species
			richness is one indicator that a community is healthy and relatively unaffected by human
			activities.
