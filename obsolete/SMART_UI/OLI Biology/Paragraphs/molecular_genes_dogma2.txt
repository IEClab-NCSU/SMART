In eukaryotic
				cells, DNA stores the genetic information, which is passed from generation to
			generation through the process of DNA replication. During replication,
			the whole sequence of DNA is copied. In order for the information stored in DNA to be used by a
			living cell, the information must be expressed (gene expression). First,
			DNA is transcribed into one form of RNA called messenger
			RNA, or mRNA, through the process of transcription;
			then mRNA can be translated into an amino acid sequence forming a protein
			through the process of translation. The ribosome translates the RNA
			sequence into a protein sequence, using three nucleotide bases to encode each amino
			acid. DNA also encodes two other RNA molecules, transfer RNA (tRNA) and
				ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Although these RNA molecules do not directly
			encode proteins, they are both required for protein synthesis.
