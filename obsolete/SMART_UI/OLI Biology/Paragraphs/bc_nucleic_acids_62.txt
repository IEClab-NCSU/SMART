Specific base pairing in DNA is the key to copying the DNA or reading the information in
			DNA: if we know the sequence of one strand, we can use base pairing rules to build the
			other strand! The process of copying DNA is called DNA replication
			(think of making a copy or a replica!). Before a cell divides, it must first make a copy
			of its DNA using DNA replication. The enzyme catalyzing DNA replication is called DNA
			polymerase (makes the new DNA polymer). One double stranded DNA molecule when
			replicated, will become two double stranded molecules, each containing one original
			strand and one newly synthesized strand. The synthesis of the new DNA strand can only
			happen in one direction: from the 5’to the 3’ end,that is the new bases are always added
			to the 3’ end of the newly synthesized DNA. The ‘learn by doing” activity below will
			help you understand the process of DNA replication in more detail.
