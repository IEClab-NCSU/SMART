Mitosis begins when DNA condenses into chromosomes visible under a light microscope. This packaging of the
					chromosomes into condensed bundles makes them easier to sort, but it inhibits
					protein synthesis. Therefore, it is essential that the cell has produced all
					necessary proteins prior to the start of this process.
