AIDS was first recognized and tied to the HIV virus in the early 1980s. At that time a
			diagnosis of HIV infection was considered a death sentence as there were no available
			treatments. The first breakthrough in HIV treatment came about in 1986 when zidovudine
			(also known as AZT) was introduced in the United States. AZT works by blocking the
			activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. AZT was hailed as a HUGE medical
			breakthrough, and it worked well at keeping the viral infection in check. AZT would
			remain the only treatment available for HIV until the early 1990s when other reverse
			transcriptase inhibitor drugs as well as drugs that inhibited the HIV protease were
			introduced. With AZT and the new drugs available the scientific and medical communities
			thought that the struggles of managing this disease were over! Having HIV was no longer
			a death sentence! Infected patients could simply be given any one of these drugs, and
			live fairly normal lives as long as they continued treatment. However, by the mid 1990s,
			it became apparent that there was a problem. Patients whose infections had been well
			controlled (even for many years) started once again to exhibit symptoms of AIDS and
			their health deteriorated rapidly. While this turn of events may seem perplexing, the
			explanation has everything to do with microevolution.
