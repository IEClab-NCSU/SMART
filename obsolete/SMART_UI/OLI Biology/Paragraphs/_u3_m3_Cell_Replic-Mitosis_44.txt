For example, genes that inhibit cell division are classified as tumor suppressor
					genes. If these genes are working properly, a cell will not divide
				uncontrollably because these genes will stop the process. Genes that encourage cell
				division are called proto-oncogenes. If these genes are working properly, a
				cell will not receive the message to divide unless it should be dividing.
