Community ecology deals with interactions among different species of living
                    organisms. An ecological community is made up of all of the populations that
                    live in an area and interact with each other. One statistic used to describe
                    communities is species richness: the total number of different species that are
                    present. Often high species richness is an indicator of a healthy community that
                    is not very heavily altered or disturbed by human activities.
