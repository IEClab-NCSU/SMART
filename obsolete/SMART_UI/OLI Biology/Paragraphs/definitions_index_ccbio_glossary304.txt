One type of the long fatty acid molecules comprising fats and olis
                                (i.e., triglycerides). Saturated fatty acids have no carbon-carbon
                                double bonds. All of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds and
                                each carbon is bonded to two or three hydrogen atoms; each carbon is
                                “saturated” with hydrogen. All the bonds are single therefore the
                                entire fatty acid can form a linear shape. Saturated fats tend to
                                have a higher melting point and are likely to be solid at room
                                temparature; e.g., butter and lard.
