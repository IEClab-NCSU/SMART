Many folded proteins bind small organic molecules that assist the protein in performing its
				function. For example, the heme group in myoglobin (colored gray in the right image)
				is not part of the protein chain, but fits within a pocket in the myoglobin protein.
				Myoglobin is responsible for binding oxygen in muscles. Heme groups also are present
				in the oxygen transport protein, hemoglobin.
