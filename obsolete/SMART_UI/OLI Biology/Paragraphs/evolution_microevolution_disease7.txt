By the late 1990s, doctors and scientists came to the conclusion that in order to
			continue to treat HIV effectively, they needed to approach the problem from multiple
			fronts - as you just discovered in the above Learn By Doing activity. New drugs were
			developed that targeted different parts of the virus, current drugs were administered
			together, and when it became clear that a drug was no longer working for a patient, the
			patient was given a different one. The end result of all of this work was the
			development of what is known today as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy or HAART. HAART generally consists of one protease
			inhibitor given in concert with one or two other anti-HIV drugs that target different
			aspects of the virus. To date, there are over 30 drugs approved for use in the treatment
			of HIV.
