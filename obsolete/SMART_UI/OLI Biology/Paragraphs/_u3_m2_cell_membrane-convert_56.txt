Cells with a cell wall (such as plant and bacterial cells) respond somewhat
				differently to these situations. The cell wall will keep these cell from bursting in
				a hypotonic solution. In a hypotonic solution, the pressure created by the rigidity
				of the cell wall forces water back out of the cell. In fact, plant cells do best in
				slightly hypotonic solutions, which results in plump, healthy cells. Isotonic
				solutions result in somewhat limp plant cells. Plant cells are most sensitive to
				hypertonic solutions. In hypertonic solutions, the plasma membrane tears as it
				shrivels away from the cell wall. This solution will kill the cells.
