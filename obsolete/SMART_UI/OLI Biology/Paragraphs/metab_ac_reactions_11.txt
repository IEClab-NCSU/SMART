Most life on Earth is fueled by solar energy through the process of
				photosynthesis. Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight to make organic
			molecules from simple raw materials (carbon dioxide and water). Cellular
				respiration and other processes break down organic molecules and use the
			energy released to build ATP molecules. ATP then transfers energy to drive many important processes
			in cells including movement, transport, and synthesis. In this way, the energy from the
			sun is transformed to chemical energy in molecules such as glucose and ATP. Eventually
				energy is
			released in forms like motion, heat, sound, or light. Each chemical transformation
			process releases heat as a byproduct. In fact, most of the energy is lost as heat, only
			a small fraction is used to do work. This heat can be useful for organisms to regulate
			their internal temperatures.
