Protein that binds to DNA near promoter sites, reducing the amount of
                                mRNA that is generated from that promoter, and consequently the
                                amount of protein that is translated from the mRNA. The ability of
                                the repressor to bind to DNA is often controlled by small molecules,
                                i.e. the lac repressor is released from DNA in the presence of
                                lactose.
