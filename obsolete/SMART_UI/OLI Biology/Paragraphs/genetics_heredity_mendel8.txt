Letâ€™s see what happened during that first cross. You will use a tool called a Punnett
            square, which graphically shows the possible combinations of the gametes of the parents.
            In a Punnett square, you place the possible gametes from each parent along the top and
            left side of the square. What you are representing here is the Law of
                Segregation: during meiosis
                I, the chromosome pair separates, resulting in haploid gametes. Each
                gamete will have only one allele.
