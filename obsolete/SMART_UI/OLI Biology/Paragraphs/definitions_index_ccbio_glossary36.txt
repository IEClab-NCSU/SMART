Materials capable of natural decomposition and which break down into
                                nutrients or elements that can be recycled. Biodegradable materials
                                are more sustainable over time because they can be recycled in an
                                ecosystem or biogeochemical cycle. Nonbiodegradable materials tend
                                to accumulate over time and may cause negative environmental
                                impacts.
