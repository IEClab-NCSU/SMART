Until the late 1600s, only large life forms such as plants and animals were known
					to science. Scientists and common folk alike were totally ignorant of the
					teeming microscopic life forms that inhabit our world. In fact, they didnâ€™t even
					know that plants and animals are composed of cells! Our understanding of life
					was very poor.
