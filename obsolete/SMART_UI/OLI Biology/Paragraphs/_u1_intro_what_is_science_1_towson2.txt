To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called
                    “scientific inquiry.” Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural
                    world and predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of
                    science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices 
                    were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders.Today, with science-based
                    medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health.
                    According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has
                    increased by more than 30 years since 1900.
