Have you ever filled up a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more
			drops? Before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the
			glass. This water can stay above the edges of the glass because of the property of
				cohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other
			(because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together. Cohesion allows
				surface tension, the capacity of a liquidâ€™s surface to resist being
			ruptured when placed under tension or stress. When water is sprinkled onto a solid
			surface, surface tension causes the water to remain in compact droplets instead of
			spreading out into a thin film.
