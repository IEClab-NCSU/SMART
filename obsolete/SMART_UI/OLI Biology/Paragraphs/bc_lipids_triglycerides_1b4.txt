Historically, it was believed that synthetic trans
				unsaturated fats would be as “good for you” as natural unsaturated fats. However,
				recent studies have shown that consumption of trans fat may pose a significant
				health risk. Consuming a lot of trans fat can lead to an increase in levels of
				low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This in turn is associated with a higher risk of
				heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans
				fats, and many products have been reformulated so that they are much lower in trans
				fats. However, trans fats are still a common ingredient in many processed foods;
				close reading of ingredient and nutrition labels is recommended.
