All this work requires energy. Most factories need some sort of power
							plant that converts fuel into a form of energy that can be captured to
							do work. In the cell, this job is accomplished by organelles called
									mitochondria (singular form is
									"mitochondrion"), which take fuel in the
							form of sugar (glucose) and convert it to usable energy â€”
									ATP.
