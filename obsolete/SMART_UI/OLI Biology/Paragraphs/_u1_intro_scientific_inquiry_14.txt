The rest of this module will focus on the methods of scientific inquiry. Science often
					involves making observations and developing hypotheses. Experiments and/or further
					observations are often used to test the hypotheses, and the data gathered are
					carefully interpreted. Methods and results are then communicated to other
					scientists within peer-reviewed scientific journals.
