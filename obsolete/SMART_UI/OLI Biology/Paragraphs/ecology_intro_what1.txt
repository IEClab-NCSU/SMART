In exploring biology thus far, we have focused on life from the “skin in”—you
					have learned about the structure and function of cells and have explored the
					chemical processes that enable life. But biology does not stop with this
					inward-looking perspective. Biology also looks from the skin out at the
					individual’s life in context. Biologists explore how you and other organisms get
					food, how you change the world around you and in turn are influenced by factors
					like temperature, environmental toxins, and other organisms.
