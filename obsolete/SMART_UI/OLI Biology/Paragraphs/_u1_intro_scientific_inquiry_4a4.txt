Truly scientific research is published in reputable peer-reviewed journals. These
                    journals exclude pseudoscience rigorously. If you hear that some idea is
                    “scientifically proven,” check the source to see if there’s any reference to a
                    scientific journal. Track down the article to see if it really supports the
                    claim. Finally, double check to make sure that the publication is a respected
                    peer-reviewed journal. One way to get this information is to ask a scientist at
                    a research university, consult with a librarian, or do a careful Internet
                    search. Your ability to distinguish between science and pseudoscience will help
                    you be a scientifically literate citizen.
