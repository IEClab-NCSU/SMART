For the organs of the human body to function, they must be protected from
                    potentially damaging substances in the environment. One level of defense is
                    provided by the 
integumentary


system, made up of the skin, hair, and nails. This system prevents
                    many potentially harmful irritants from entering the body. Eyelashes, for
                    example, help keep sand or other items out of the eyes, where they could
                    potentially cause serious damage, and the skin prevents most pathogens
                    (disease-causing microorganisms) from entering the body and destroying healthy
                    body cells. Certain parts of the 
skeletal


system, such as the skull and ribcage, also help to protect the
                    internal organs, such as the brain, heart and lungs, from damage. The skeletal
                    system and the 
muscular


system also support the body and allow it to move away from danger,
                    toward food sources, etc. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems also help
                    defend the bodyâ€™s cells from foreign organisms that may enter the body tissues
                    or fluids through the process of immunity.
