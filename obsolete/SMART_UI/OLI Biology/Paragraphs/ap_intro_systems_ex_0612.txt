The pulmonary artery (part of the pulmonary circuit) carries
                    oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for
                    oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The pulmonary veins
                    carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart.
