Have you ever heard a news report about acid rain and wondered: “Is it really
					that big of a deal?” Ecologists (specialized biologists who study ecology) have
					observed what happens to the health of ecosystems when acid rain falls. They can
					tell you about the consequences in detail and can even predict which ecosystems
					will be most affected based on the chemistry of the underlying rocks! Have you
					ever wondered if there could be life in space, on the moon, or on Mars?
					Astrobiologists study conditions on other planets and design experiments to help
					answer those questions. In short, biology and science are all around us and
					inside us. To better understand the world around us and your own life and
					health, it is essential that you know something of the principles of biology
					that are at work all day, every day in our bodies and on the planet.
