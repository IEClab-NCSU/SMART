In addition, most organisms are fed upon by more than one species. A mice could be eaten
			by a snake, but it could also be eaten by an owl, a hawk, or a house cat. A complete
			food web shows all of these possible feeding relationships. In diagrams that depict food
			chains or food webs, the arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism
			doing the eating. In other words, the arrows follow the flow of energy and nutrients
			through the ecosystem.
