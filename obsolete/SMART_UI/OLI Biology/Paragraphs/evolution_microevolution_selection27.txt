Selection occurs whenever some genetic types in a population reproduce more than
					others in a given environment. In natural selection, the types that succeed are
					those that survive and/or grow the best. In sexual selection, mating success is
					key. In artificial selection, humans
					decide which types reproduce best: we deliberately breed certain
					individuals with desired traits.
