 An ecosystem consists of all the organisms living within a defined area along
                    with the abiotic
                    components of that particular environment. Within an ecosystem, organisms
                    interact with each other in helpful and harmful ways. Some types of organisms
                    play overlapping roles with other species (e.g., six species of oak tree may
                    have similar, if not identical, roles in a forest). Others, however, play unique
                    and essential roles that other organisms depend upon for their survival. For
                    example, in a Colorado forest, researchers found that a species of sapsucker (a
                    bird similar to a woodpecker) played a vital role in providing nesting holes and
                    food for many other species.
