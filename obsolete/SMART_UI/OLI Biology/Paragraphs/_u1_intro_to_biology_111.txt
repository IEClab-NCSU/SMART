In the remainder of this Unit, you will continue to explore some of the most
					basic principles of Biology. You will explore the difference between living and
					non-living things in Module 2. Module 3 of this unit will focus on the Hierarchy
					of Life. That is to say, you will begin to see how all of life is built from
					smaller things that combine to form larger more complex ones. In Module 4, you
					will be introduced to the common themes of the course: Energy, Pathways and
					Regulation. You will find that these three concepts appear over and over again
					throughout the course. Lastly, we will learn about the Scientific Method in
					Module 5. In this module youâ€™ll learn about some of the key tools, ideas, and
					problem-solving methods that are used by biologists to ask and answer scientific
					questions about life.
