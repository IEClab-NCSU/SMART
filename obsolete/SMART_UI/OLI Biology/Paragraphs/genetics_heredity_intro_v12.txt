In the Cell
                    Division unit, you learned that cells pass on a complete
            set of genetic information (contained in the DNA), which is transmitted from parent
            cells to daughter cells. This genetic information helps determine many of the
            characteristics of the offspring. In humans, for instance, DNA is
            responsible for a childâ€™s height and skin pigmentation. It also helps determine the
            overall health of the child by regulating many physiological characteristics, such as
            the condition of the heart and lungs, as well as brain and blood chemistry.
