In a water molecule, oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen. This means that oxygen has
					a greater affinity or attraction for the shared electron pair than hydrogen
					does. Because of this, the electrons tend to spend more time close to the oxygen
					atom and they spend less time close to the hydrogen atom. As a result, the
					oxygen becomes slightly negative and each hydrogen atom develops a slightly
					positive charge. Whenever two atoms with different electronegativities form a
					covalent bond, we say that the bond between the atoms is
						polar, with each atom carrying a partial charge.
					Oxygen and nitrogen are the two highly electronegative elements that are often
					bonded to hydrogen in biological molecules. O-H and N-H bonds are strongly
					polar, and this sets the stage for hydrogen bonding.
