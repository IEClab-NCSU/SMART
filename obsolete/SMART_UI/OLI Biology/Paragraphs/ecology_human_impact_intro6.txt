As a consumer, voter, employee, or business leader, you have some control over
            environmental impact in your daily decisions. You should have a clear sense for
            what sustainability really means. Sustainable technologies
            meet human needs—economic and social—and preserve the productivity or
            biodiversity of ecosystems over a long period of time. In any given case,
            different options may maximize individual economic benefit, public welfare, or
            environmental integrity. The most sustainable choice often involves finding a
            compromise among these competing priorities.
