Energy flow and nutrient cycling are themes in biology at every level. In your
                    body, energy from food is processed and released, explaining the existence of
                    body heat. Excess energy intake leads to weight gain that can threaten your
                    health. A proper balance of nutrients is required to give you the building
                    blocks you need to grow and maintain your bodyâ€™s tissues. Chemical waste
                    products must be removed by organs like your liver, kidneys, and lungs.
