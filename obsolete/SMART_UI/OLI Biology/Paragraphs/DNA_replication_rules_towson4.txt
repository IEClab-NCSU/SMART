The replication rate for the eukaryotic replication fork has been measured to be
          approximately 50 bp/sec. This means that for a eukaryotic chromosome of 10e8 bp to
          completely replicate starting at one origin of replication it would take approximately 23
          days. While we know that the life-cycles of eukaryotic cells are extremely variable, the
          S-phase, the period of time during the eukaryotic life-cycle when DNA is replicated,
          typically last 8 hours. To explain the enormous difference in time scale, it has been
          found that the eukaryotic chromosome has multiple origins of replication. The
          eukaryotic replication units have upwards of 80 origins which means the replication time
          is reduced to approximately 7 hrs.
