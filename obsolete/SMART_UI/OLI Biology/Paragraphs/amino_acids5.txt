Chirality: Because there are four different groups attached to the central carbon, the
					â€“carbon is an asymmetric or chiral center. The chiral center gives rise to D and
					L enantiomers for each amino acid. However, where bioselectivity dictated the
					dominance of D carbohydrates, the same discrimination process for amino acids
					gives rise to the dominance of the use of L amino acids in nature.
