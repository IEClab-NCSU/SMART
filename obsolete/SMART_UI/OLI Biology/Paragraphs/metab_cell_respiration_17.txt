The first step of respiration is glycolysis which happens in the cytosol (cytoplasm) of a cell. “Glyco” refers to
					sugar and “lysis” means to breakdown or degrade. So,
					this step is essentially the breaking of a sugar molecule in half. Glucose is
					the most common sugar used in this process. Glucose is a six carbon sugar. In
					glycolysis, glucose is split into two three-carbon molecules called
							pyruvate. This metabolic pathway breaks down
					glucose with or without oxygen. It is the first stage of cellular respiration
					and fermentation (anaerobic respiration). Splitting the bonds of
					glucose releases enough energy to make 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules. NADH (and
						FADH2) are electron carriers. You will see why these are
					important in a moment.
