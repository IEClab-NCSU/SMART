Cell division is an essential life process that ensures the passage of genetic information from
            one generation to the next. Mitosis results in two identical diploid cells and occurs in
            somatic cells. Meiosis results in four unique haploid cells and takes place in the
            gonads. Two different processes are necessary because they serve two different
            functions. Mitosis allows for growth of an organism and replacement of cells. Meiosis
            allows for sexual reproduction.
