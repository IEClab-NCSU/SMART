The invention and refinement of the microscope changed all that. Today we are aware of a vast
					diversity of single-celled, microscopic life forms that interact with us every
					day. In fact, in and on your body, bacterial cells outnumber your own human
					cells 10 to one. The bacteria that live on and in you are often critically
					important to your own health and well being. Bacteria have mutually beneficial
					relationships with every large organism on Earth and they also cleanse the water
					we drink and renew the air we breathe. While bacteria can be invaluable partners
					in the quest for healthy living, it is also well known that bacteria cause
					disease. Interestingly, this fact was not fully demonstrated until the late
					1800s. The earliest measures taken to control bacterial diseases involved
					improving sanitation using procedures such as sterile surgical techniques, water
					purification, and sewage treatment. While these strategies helped reduce
					infections caused by bacteria, it didnâ€™t change the fact that once bacterial
					infections took hold, they were often fatal.
