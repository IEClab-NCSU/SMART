An organism is a cell or group of cells that lives and
					reproduces as a single unit. Organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye
					are called microorganisms. Some organisms consist of
					just one cell (they are unicellular) and include prokaryotes such as bacteria.
					Other organisms consist of many cells working together. These multicellular
					organisms include animals, land plants, and most fungi. Most multicellular
					organisms have cells that are specialized to carry out specific functions. Tissues are formed when many cells work together to
					fulfill the same detailed function. Organs are
					collections of tissues that work together to carry out a more general function.
					Organs are present not only in most animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that
					consists of functionally related organs.
