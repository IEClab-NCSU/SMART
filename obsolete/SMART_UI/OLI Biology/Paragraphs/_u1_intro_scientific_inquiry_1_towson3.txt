A scientific experiment 
					is a carefully organized procedure in which the scientist intervenes in a system to 
					change something, and then observes the result of the change. Scientific inquiry often
					involves doing experiments, though not always. For example, a scientist studying the mating
					behaviors of ladybugs might begin with detailed observations of ladybugs mating in their 
					natural habitats. While this research may not be experimental, it is scientific: it involves 
					careful and verifiable observation of the natural world. The same scientist might then treat 
					some of the ladybugs with a hormone hypothesized to trigger mating and observe whether these
					ladybugs mated sooner or more often than untreated ones. This would qualify as an experiment
					because the scientist is now making a change in the system and observing the effects.
