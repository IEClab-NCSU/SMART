Ka  is the ratio of the mathematical product of the concentration of each product of the reaction (in this case the charged species) to the concentration of the reactants (in this case the neutral species). The square brackets [ ] around the terms indicate concentration and is usually expressed in molar concentration (moles/Liter). In the Learn By Doing you will explore the equilibrium of an acid dissociation in pure water. In this simulation you can assume the concentration is molecules per beaker and thus the concentration will be equal to the total number of molecules in the experiment.
