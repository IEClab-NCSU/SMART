In this module you learned that nucleotides are the monomers that make up the nucleic
			acid polymers. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide. It
			consists of a single adenosine (the base adenine and the sugar ribose), linked to three
			phosphate ions. ATP has an essential function: it is the universal energy source; it
			acts as a general energy source for most cellular activities. Photosynthetic organisms
				(primarily plants and bacteria) get their energy from the
			sun. Animals get their energy second- or third-hand from digesting plants and other
			organisms (i.e., the food and other nutrients we eat). Regardless of the source, for
			living organisms energy is converted to the chemical bond energy contained in the ATP
			molecule.
