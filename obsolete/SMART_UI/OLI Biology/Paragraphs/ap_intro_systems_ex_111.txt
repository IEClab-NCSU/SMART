The muscular (musculoskeletal) system generates force for movement of bones
                    around articulations, facial expression, breathing, posture, and assists with
                    temperature regulation. The muscular system only contains skeletal muscle,
                    although the body also has smooth and cardiac muscle tissue, which are important
                    in other body systems. There are over 650 skeletal muscles in the human
                    body!
