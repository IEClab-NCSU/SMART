A predominate feature of the DNA double helix is the presence of grooves, or indentations, on the side of the helix.  This grooves expose the edges of  the basepairs,  The grooves are called the major groove and the minor groove. Both grooves are deep and expose the edges of the bases to the external environment, making them accessible for protein binding.  The minor groove is quite narrow (approximately 12 Angstroms across) and while the edges of the bases may be accessible to solvent and small molecules, they are generally not accessible to larger molecules. The major groove on the other hand is quite wide (approximately 22 Angstroms across) and is sufficiently wide to accommodate a protein alpha helix.  Below is a side view of the B-DNA structure using a space filled model (left) next to a 3D Jmol image that will allow you to highlight  each groove and determine which atoms from each basepair project into the groove.  The nature of the atoms that are exposed in the grooves of the structure are important for the ability of proteins to recognize specific sequences of DNA. Discrimination of the different sequences must be made by having access to the bases inside the structure since the backbone structure is common to all sequences of DNA
