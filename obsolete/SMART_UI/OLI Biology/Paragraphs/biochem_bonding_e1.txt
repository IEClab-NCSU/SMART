Recall that in a covalent bond, the electrons are shared between two atoms. However, the two
			atoms donâ€™t necessarily share the electrons equally. Some atoms are more likely to draw
			the shared electrons closer to themselves. Atoms have a high electronegativity if they
			tend to draw the electrons towards them. Electronegativity increases as one moves from the
			left to the right across the periodic table. Hydrogen is moderately electronegative,
			with a value of 2.1, carbon is somewhat more electronegative, with a value of 2.5, and
			fluorine is the most electronegative atom, with a value of 4.0.
