For centuries, humans observed traits in themselves and in the animals and plants
                    surrounding them. They realized that they were passed on from one generation to
                    another, although not in a completely unequivocal way. Breeders of plants and
                    animals figured out ways to enhance their traits by selecting individuals with
                    the desired characteristics and crossing them with each other. But it was not
                    until the experiments of Gregor Mendel in the nineteenth century that patterns
                    of inheritance started to become clearer. Based on a simple model, the pea
                    plant, with easily observable phenotypes governing flower colors, seed shape,
                    and so on, he proposed that hereditary information was passed along in discrete
                    units he called genes (at that time DNA was not known), and that genes could
                    have two alternatives or alleles. According to Mendelâ€™s laws, alleles segregate
                    during sexual reproduction, and combine independently from each other. We know
                    now that genes are DNA sequences found in chromosomes, and the segregation is
                    due to the process of meiosis you have already learned about.
