Another environmental problem involving pH balance is acid rain. When nitrogen oxides and
				sulfur dioxide, two common by-products of burning fossil fuels, combine with water
				in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, acid rain is produced. In some regions, acid rain reduces
				the pH of fresh water sources like streams, rivers, and lakes. It also may change
				soil chemistry and harm plants. Some regions have rocks and soils that contain
				buffers, and they are less susceptible to damage from acid rain. However, when soil
				buffering capacity is exhausted (buffers cannot accept any more hydrogen ions), pH
				may decline very quickly. Tighter regulations on coal-burning power plants have
				helped reduce the acid rain problem in recent decades, but it remains a threat to
				some forest and aquatic ecosystems and the organisms living within them. We will
				learn more about acid rain in the Ecology unit.
