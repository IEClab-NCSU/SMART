Since the hydrogen ion concentations are usually much less than one, and can vary over many orders of magnitude, a different scale is used for the hydrogen ion concentration, the pH scale.   The pH is the -log of the proton concentration: pH = - log [H+].  The log conversion reduces a 10 fold change in hydrogen ion concentration to a one unit change in pH.  The minus sign changes the negative numbers that would be obtained from log[H+] to positive ones.   Since the pH scale is an inverse scale the concentration of protons is high at low pH and low at high pH.  A solution is said to be acidic if the pH is less than seven, and basic if the pH is above 7.  A solution is neutral if its pH is equal to 7.0.
