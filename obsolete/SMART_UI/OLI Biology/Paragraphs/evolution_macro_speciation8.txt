How could sympatric speciation happen? The drive to reproduce generally maintains the
            integrity of species by assuring that all their populations will exchange genes with
            each other. Sympatric speciation goes against this tendency; it requires the formation
            of a group of finicky, “cliquish” breeders. Most of the well-known examples involve
            genetic errors that produce offspring with extra chromosomes, a condition known as
            polyploidy. Sometimes polyploid types form new species that can breed with each other
            but are incompatible with the original species. Second, changes in ecology and breeding
            habits can also isolate a group within a species.
