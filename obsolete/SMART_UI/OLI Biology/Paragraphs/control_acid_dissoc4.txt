 To quantify how the equilibrium point is affected by pH, it is instructive to
					rearrange the equilibrium equation to generate the Hendersson-Hasselbach
					equation. First we start with the general equilibrium equation for
					Ka: 





K
=






[


A


-


]


[


H


+


]




[
HA
]










 and then take the -log of both sides of the equation. 









log

(
K
)


=

log

(



[


A


-


]




[
HA
]



)

log

(
[


H


+


]
)









 You may recognize that -log(Ka) is pKa and the
						-log([H+]) is pH. By substituting these into the equation we have
					the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation. 










pH

=
pKa

log

(



[


A


-


]




[
HA
]



)










 This equation can be used to calculate the ratio of
					[A-]/[HA] for any weak acid, provided the pKa of the acid
					and the pH of the solution are known.
