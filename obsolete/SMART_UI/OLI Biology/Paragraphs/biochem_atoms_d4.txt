A key characteristic of atoms is that they are most stable when they have full
					outer electron shells. Helium (He) has a full outer shell with two electrons;
					directly below it in the periodic table is Neon. Neon (Ne) has an inner shell with
					two electrons and a full second shell with eight electrons. In fact, all of the
					elements in that column of the periodic table have full outer shells, are
					stable, and do not react with other elements.
