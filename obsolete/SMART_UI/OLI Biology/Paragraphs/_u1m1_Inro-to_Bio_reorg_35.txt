Living things are highly organized and structured at levels that can be examined
					on a scale from small to large. In this course, the smallest level we will
					examine is the atom which is the basic unit of matter.
					The atom consists of a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms join
					together to form molecules. A molecule is a chemical
					structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a chemical bond. Macromolecules are large, biologically important
					molecules.
