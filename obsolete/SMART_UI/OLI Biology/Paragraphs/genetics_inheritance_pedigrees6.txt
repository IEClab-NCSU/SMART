A trait that is significantly more common in males than females is likely to be X-linked.
            Again, in a real-world situation a much larger sample size would be needed to be sure of
            these conclusions. The X-linked traits used here are also recessive, so you will notice
            that they show both characteristics of being X-linked (mostly males) and characteristics
            of being recessive (child demonstrating a trait that neither parent has).
