Photosynthetic producers have evolved an effective system for absorbing light and
			converting it into chemical energy. This biochemical solar energy system
			begins with a diverse array of (mostly green) pigments that are embedded in
			membranes. In plants and algae, these pigments are contained within specialized
			subcellular organelles called chloroplasts.
