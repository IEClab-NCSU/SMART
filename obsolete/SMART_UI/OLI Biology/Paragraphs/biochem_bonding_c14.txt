Nitrogen, another example, has an atomic number of 7 (see the figure above). The outer
			shell of carbon has 5 electrons. Nitrogen can share an electron with three other atoms.
			Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. It has a single electron in its outermost shell, and
			can share this electron with one other atom. A nitrogen atom can form a covalent bond
			with three hydrogen atoms to form a molecule called ammonia, NH3 . In an
			ammonia molecule, nitrogen effectively has a “full” second shell (8 electrons) and each
			hydrogen has a “full” second shell (two electrons).
