In Meiosis II (which is essentially like mitosis), the sister chromatids
			separate from each other. Thus, as the result of meiosis, four haploid cells are
			produced. Note that those four cells are not always viable. In humans, male germ cells
			will produce four viable sperm cells. However, in the case of females, only one of the
			four will survive as an egg.
