The cell membrane provides a semipermeable barrier between the
			inside and the outside of the cell. The phospholipid bilayer
			structure of the membrane allows selected ions and
					organic molecules to pass through the plasma membrane and
			regulates the movement of molecular substances. This characteristic of the membrane,
			known as selective permeability, acts as a filter that allows only
			selected substances that are needed for the survival and functioning of the cell in and
			out. The movement of molecular substances across the membrane can occur passively
			without the cell exerting energy or it can occur through the cell's use of energy to
			transport substances. Selective permeability affects the energy required to transport
			substances in and out of the cell. This page will explore the conditions under which
			molecules can pass across the membrane passively through diffusion.
