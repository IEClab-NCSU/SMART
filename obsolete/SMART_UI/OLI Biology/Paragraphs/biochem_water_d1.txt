Imagine you have placed a metal pan containing water on the stove. You transfer heat energy
			to the pan. If you touch the metal pan after a few minutes, it is warm or even hot to
			the touch, but the water does not yet feel warm. The metal’s temperature changes much
			more quickly than that of the water, even though both substances are receiving heat from
			the same source. Temperature is a measure of the vibrational energy of molecules within
			a substance; it reflects how fast the molecules are jiggling around. If you add heat to
			metal, the molecules respond quickly with an increase in their “jiggling” and the
			temperature increases rapidly. If you add the same amount of heat to water, the
			molecules respond much less quickly. Why is water’s temperature so resistant to
			change?
