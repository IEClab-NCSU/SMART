All living things need energy to run the processes required for life.
						Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. You can think of
					“work” as any change that won’t happen on its own. Work can involve movement,
					building larger molecules, increasing the concentration of chemicals, increasing
					the temperature of an object, making a sound, or even glowing
					(bioluminescence).
