While enantiomers usually undergo chemical reactions in an identical fashion,
					biological systems are capable of discriminating between these structurally
					different molecules because biological systems themselves contain chiral
					centers, such as in amino acids. The ability to discriminate between the
					enantiomers is an example of bioselectivity. The chemical world has been
					narrowed by the selective use of specific enantiomers (in this case only
					D-glyceraldehyde) by biological systems.
