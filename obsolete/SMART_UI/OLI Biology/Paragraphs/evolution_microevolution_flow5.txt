Let's consider for a moment the gene that encodes the alpha-amylase enzyme. This enzyme
			is found in saliva and begins the process of digesting starches in your mouth. Assume
			that you were born with a new mutant version of the alpha-amylase gene. You produce a
			form of the enzyme that very efficiently digests starch. No one else in the world
			carries this form of the alpha-amylase gene in their cells. So as a result of this
			mutation, a new allele has been introduced in the gene pool of your population and of
			the entire human race. The type and frequency of the alleles and genotypes in your
			population has changed (ever so slightly)â€¦ so evolution has occurred. Will this change
			have a meaningful effect on the entire population or species?
			That depends on what happens next.
