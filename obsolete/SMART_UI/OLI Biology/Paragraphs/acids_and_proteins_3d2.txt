First, the enzyme binds to the substrate and slightly distorts its shape. The change in
			shape activates the substrate molecule and decreases the total activation energy
			required for the substrate to be turned into product. As the number of activated
			substrate molecules increases, so does the conversion of substrate to product. An
			analogy for this effect is a ski hill, with skiers at the bottom of one side of the hill
			representing substrates, skiers on the top of the hill representing activated
			substrates, and the products being the number of skiers that ski down the other side. If
			the height of the hill is lowered (due to the presence of the enzyme), then more skiers
			can make it to the top, increasing the number that ski down to become products.
