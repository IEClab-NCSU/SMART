To answer this question, you first need to know that in chemistry, atoms or molecules
				are often counted. Sometimes you use a word to represent the quantity of something.
				For example, you might call 12 cookies a dozen cookies. You can count cookies by the
					dozen. In chemistry, we count molecules by the mole. While one
				dozen is equal to 12, one mole is equal to 6.02 x 10^23. In other words, one
					mole of molecules is equal to 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
				molecules!
