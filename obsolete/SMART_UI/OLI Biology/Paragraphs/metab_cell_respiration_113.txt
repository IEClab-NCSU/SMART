A helpful analogy for understanding how the electron transport chain works is a
					hydroelectric dam. In a hydroelectric dam, the dam separates an area of high
					water concentration from an area of low water concentration. Water is allowed to
					flow downhill through turbines in the dam. As the water flows through these
					turbines it turns a water wheel. The motion of the wheel is used to generate
					electricity. In the electron transport chain, the protons
					flow down their concentration gradient through a protein called “ATP
					synthase”. This protein works like a water wheel and transforms the energy from
					the movement of the protons into the chemical energy of ATP.
