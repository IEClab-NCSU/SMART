An organism constantly interacts with its environment. In order to survive, the
                    human body must obtain food, water, and oxygen from the world around it. The
                    human body must also rid itself of wastes before they build up to toxic levels.
                    Two organ systems are primarily responsible for exchange of material with the
                    environment. The 
digestive


system brings food and water into the body and eliminates solid
                    wastes. The 
respiratory


system brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.
