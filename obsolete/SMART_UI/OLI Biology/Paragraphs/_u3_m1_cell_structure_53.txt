Cell division is a carefully regulated process. There are “check-points” between phases,
			in which the cell “self-checks.” Through molecular interactions, the cell makes sure
			that it is ready to divide; for example, it checks to see that its
				DNA has not been damaged. If all criteria are met, the cell
			moves forward through the cell cycle. Normal cells usually divide only a limited number
			of times, and usually do so when stimulated by certain molecular signals. For example,
			if you move to higher altitude, your body will produce more red blood cells in order to
			supply enough oxygen despite the thinner air. Cancer cells, on the other hand, have lost
			the normal cell cycle controls, and therefore can divide indefinitely.
