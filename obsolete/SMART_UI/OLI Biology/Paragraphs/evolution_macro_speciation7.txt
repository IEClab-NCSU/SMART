In some cases many closely-related species all live in the same geographic area and there
            is no known barrier that divides them today or in the recent geologic past. These
            species likely formed through sympatric speciation, which occurs without help from a physical barrier to dispersal. The diagram below shows a
            general model for sympatric speciation:
