The ability of an atom to draw shared electrons closer to itself. Strongly
                        electronegative atoms bonded to weakly electronegative hydrogen atoms, in a
                        molecule, result in hydrogen bonding. The most important strongly
                        electronegative elements in biological systems are oxygen and nitrogen.
