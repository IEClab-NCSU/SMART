			As discussed previously, proteins bind and release their ligands. In this section we will
			explore the reversible binding and the equilibrium state. We will use myoglobin, as an
			example, to explore the equilibrium established between the bound protein ligand complex
			and free reactants. Myoglobin is a single polypeptide chain protein that binds oxygen to
			create an oxygen buffer in muscle cells. The reversibly binding of oxygen to myoglobin
			can be expressed as follows:
