In some cases it is necessary to move molecules against their concentration gradient. The
			eukaryotic cell has many compartments within the cell each surrounded by a membrane. In
			most cases the environment within the compartment is different from the environment in
			the cytoplasm. An example is the lysosome, an organelle whose function is to digest
			macromolecules delivered either from the outside of the cell or from other compartments
			within the cell. To carry out this function the lysosome maintains a very low internal
			pH compared to that of the cytoplasm. Thus there is a steep pH gradient across the
			lysosome's membrane. This contrasts with the equilibrium state, in which the
			concentration of hydrogen ions would be the same inside and outside of the lysosome.
