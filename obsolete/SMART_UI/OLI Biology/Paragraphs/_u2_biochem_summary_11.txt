Biological systems use only a small part of the total chemical repertoire. This is due to
			the number of chemical reactions that can occur under physiological conditions, and to
			the small number of chemical or functional groups compatible in biological systems. The
			physical properties of these groups define how molecules behave in biological systems at
			physiological pH and temperature. By learning the properties of these groups, you will
			be able to predict how various molecules will function, as well as which functional
			groups can be converted to others during metabolism.
