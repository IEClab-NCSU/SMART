Another important aspect of biological solutions is pH, or the hydrogen ion concentration.
                    You should be able to distinguish between an acid and a  base and be able to discuss the
                    importance of buffering in biological systems. Hydrogen
                        ions are simple structures that have a big impact on living
                    systems. The more hydrogen ions that are found in a substance, the more acidic
                    the substance. As youâ€™ll learn in the next unit, hydrogen ions can affect the
                    shape, or structure, of important biological molecules like enzymes
                    and other proteins. As you already know, structure determines
                    function. When the pH of a cell or organism changes, proteins can change shape,
                    resulting in changed function.
