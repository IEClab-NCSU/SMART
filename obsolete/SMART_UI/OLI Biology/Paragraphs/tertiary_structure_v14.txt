Stabilization of the Folded State: The tertiary structure is 
                	determined by non-covalent interactions that involve amino acid side chains 
                	(side chain and backbone interactions, or side chain-side chain interactions).  
                	Amino acid residues involved in these interactions can come from distant parts 
                	of the polypeptide chain bringing the chain into a more compact shape.  The 
                	non-covalent interactions between the side chains include the following:
