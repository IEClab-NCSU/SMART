In all chemical reactions, there is an initial input of energy that is required before the
			reaction can occur. If this initial energy requirement (called the activation energy or
			energy barrier) is small, then the reaction will happen quickly and easily. If the
			activation energy is large, then the reaction will take longer to occur. Enzymes
			function to reduce the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur.
