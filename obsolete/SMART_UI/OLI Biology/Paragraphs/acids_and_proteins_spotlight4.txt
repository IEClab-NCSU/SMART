These individuals are lactose intolerant and should avoid eating foods with high
                    lactose content, such as milk. Milk products, such as buttermilk, yogurt, and
                    cheese, cause less of a problem because the amount of lactose in these products
                    is reduced by the microorganisms that are used to make them. Lactose intolerant
                    individuals can consume milk under certain conditions.
