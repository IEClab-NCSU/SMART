Why do cells divide? Cells undergo different phases, during which they grow,
					duplicate their genetic material, and then divide. In single-celled  organisms, cell
					division results in two new individuals. Cell division in multicellular
					organisms is more complex. Most cells in multicellular organisms are somatic
						cells. Somatic cells consist of all the nonreproductive cells in an
					organism; for example, tissue cells, nerve cells, and blood cells. When somatic
					cells divide, they go through the process of mitosis,
					which is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells.
