In the previous units, you learned about the biomolecules that build up cells, the basic
			unit of life. You also learned about the structure of the cell and some of the processes
			that take place in it. Implicit in that knowledge was the notion of cells as
			continuously changing and dynamic entities: they grow, rebuild, repair, reproduce, and
			react to the external environment.
