 A cause or factor; a variable that is thought to cause another variable to
                        change. In an experiment, an independent variable is deliberately changed in
                        one group at the beginning of the study. For example, in a study to test a
                        drug, one group might be given the drug and another group would not; the
                        independent variable in this example would be whether patients were given
                        the drug.
