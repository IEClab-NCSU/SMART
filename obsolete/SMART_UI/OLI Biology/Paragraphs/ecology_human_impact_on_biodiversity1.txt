From earliest childhood, humans are fascinated by the diversity of life. Tourists flock
            to African savannas, coral reefs, and tropical rain forests, cameras at the ready. Kids’
            picture books are populated with bright, beautiful, and bizarre animal drawings.
            Television nature programs, zoos, botanical gardens, and natural history museums provide
            an up-close look at the real thing. At some level each of us feels interested in,
            inspired by, or connected to nature in some form. And we are saddened to learn that much
            of this diversity is threatened by human activity. What is at stake? What has been lost?
            What can we do to protect what’s left?
