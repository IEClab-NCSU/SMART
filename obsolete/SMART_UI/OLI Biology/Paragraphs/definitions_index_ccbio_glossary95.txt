An effect; a variable that is thought to change as a result or
                                consequence of some other variable. In an experiment, a dependent
                                variable is used to describe the result, or outcome. For example, in
                                a study to test a drug, the dependent variable might be the
                                proportion of subjects that are cured at the end of the study.
