Ribosomal-RNA (rRNA) is a large defined length of RNA that when processed is
        folded into a tertiary structure that is the scaffolding for the structure of the ribosome.
        The ribosome is a protein-RNA complex quaternary structure where protein synthesis
        (translation) takes place.
Messenger-RNA (mRNA) is a variable length of RNA whose length is dependent on the
        length of the coding needed to produce a protein by translation. This RNA is the message
        that carries the information that codes for the synthesis of a protein. It has a relatively
        short lifetime in the cell.
Transfer-RNA (tRNA) is a set of short RNA molecules generally 75-80 nucleotides
        in length. Each tRNA molecule is specific for transporting a specific amino acid to the
        ribosome during protein synthesis (translation). All of the tRNA molecules have a common,
        compact tertiary structure.
