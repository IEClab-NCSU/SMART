Macroevolution is a long-term process and includes the origin and extinction of
            species and larger taxonomic groups. Lineages (often the same as species) are
            collections of populations that evolve independently of each other. Lineages split
            through a process called speciation. Sometimes speciation occurs when populations
            are separated in space (allopatric speciation) but it also may occur without
            physical barriers (sympatric speciation).
