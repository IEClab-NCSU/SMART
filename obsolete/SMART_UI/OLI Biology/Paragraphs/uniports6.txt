The simulation below demonstrates how transmembrane protein structures from adjacent cells line up to
			form Gap Junctions, channels between cells that act as size exclusion transporters.
			While water molecules are small enough to move through the membranes, the Gap Junctions facilitate that movement and the movement of molecules up to 1500 daltons (approximately a 15 amino acid peptide) but not larger molecules.
