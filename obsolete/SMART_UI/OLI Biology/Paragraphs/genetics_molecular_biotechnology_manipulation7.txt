The presence of sticky ends on DNA fragments makes it easy to join DNA fragments. If two
            fragments are both cut with the same restriction enzyme, they will have complementary
            sticky ends. These will align and bind loosely to each other: hydrogen bonds will form
            between complementary bases.
