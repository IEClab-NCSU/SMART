Hydrogen bond (H-bond) is an interaction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a 
                                partially negative atom with unshared (lone) pair of electrons. In order for hydrogen to have 
                                sufficient partial positive charge, hydrogen must be covalently attached to a very 
                                electronegative atom (O, N, P).  Partially negative atom with lone pair of electrons must 
                                also be a highly electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.
