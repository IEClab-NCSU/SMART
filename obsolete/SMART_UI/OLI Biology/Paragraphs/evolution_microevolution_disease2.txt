In our first example of microevolution and infectious disease, we will explore the Human
			Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
			In AIDS, HIV disables the human immune system by depleting CD4 T-cells. The HIV virus
			prefers to infect these cells. HIV is an interesting virus in that it uses RNA to encode
			its genetic material instead of DNA like most viruses.
