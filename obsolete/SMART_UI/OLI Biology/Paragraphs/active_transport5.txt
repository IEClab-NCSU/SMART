Facilitated diffusion and active transport both require channels or ports in the membrane
			through which the generally non-permeable molecules can pass. These protein transporters
			contribute to the mosaic character of the fluid mosaic character of the biological
			membrane. There are a variety of different structures associated with transport proteins
			and at the same time many transport proteins that carry out similar functions (e.g. ion
			channels) have structural similarities while maintaining their ability to discriminate
			between molecules. Thus transport proteins have been classified both by structure and by
			function. For the purposes of this course, the classification will be that of function
			though similarities in structure will be observed in the examples chosen.
