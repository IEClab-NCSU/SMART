Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United
						States.
There are about 40 different types of HPV. A significant number of people that have HPV are
						unaware of it because many of these viruses cause no symptoms.
Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer.
About 4,000 women a year die of cervical cancer in the United States.
