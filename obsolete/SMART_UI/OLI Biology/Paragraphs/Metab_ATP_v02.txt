ATP is a relatively unstable molecule. Consequently it is never used for the long-term
			storage of energy in the cell. This job goes to other more stable compounds, like fats
			and sugars. ATP is specialized for direct and rapid transfers of energy. It is because
			of this instability that ATP is such a good energy currency for the cell (it’s easy to
			“spend” this energy). ATP is like cash, while long-term energy storage molecules (such
			as fats and sugars) are more like a savings account.
