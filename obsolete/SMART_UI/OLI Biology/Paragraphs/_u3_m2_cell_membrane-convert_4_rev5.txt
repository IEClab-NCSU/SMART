How are endocytosis and exocytosis important to everyday life? Immune cells protect animals by
			recognizing and destroying foreign objects such as bacteria. Disease-causing bacteria
			are recognized by proteins called receptors on the surface of the immune cell. The
			phagocytic immune cell will then engulf the bacterial cells (phagocytosis). The vesicle
			that contains these bacterial cells is called a phagosome ("phago" means "eating" and
			"-some" refers to "body"). The phagosome next fuses with lysosomes. Finally, the
			digested bacterial products are excreted through the process of exocytosis.
