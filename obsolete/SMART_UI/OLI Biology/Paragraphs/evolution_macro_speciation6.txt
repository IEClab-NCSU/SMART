The map of the world is a jigsaw puzzle of broken-up habitats (continents, oceans,
            islands, mountain ranges, lakes, caves, river systems, forests, deserts...) occupied by
            different regional or local species. Allopatric speciation helps us make sense of these
            patterns: as Earthâ€™s landscapes were reshaped and broken up by geologic processes,
            living lineages also became separated and diverged into locally adapted species.
