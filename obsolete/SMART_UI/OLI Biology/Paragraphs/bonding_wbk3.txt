 Covalent bonds are the strongest. One atom fully shares one, two or three
					electrons with another atom., forming a single, double, or triple bond,
					respectively. The bonds can be between the same element (e.g., C-C bonds) or
					between different elements (e.g., C-O, C-N, H-O). The nature of the covalent
					bond is determined by the number of electrons shared and the nature of the two
					elements attached.
