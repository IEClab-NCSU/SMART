Living things are highly organized and structured following a hierarchy that can
					be examined on a scale from small to large. The atom is
					the basic unit of matter and consists of a dense nucleus surrounded by
					electrons. Atoms join together to form molecules. A molecule
					is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a
					chemical bond. Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, which are technically polymers. Polymers
					are made by combining smaller units called monomers which are simpler
					macromolecules. An example of a macromolecule is the genetic molecule
					deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains the instructions for the development
					of all living organisms . DNA is built of four kinds of monomers (nucleotides).
					They are strung together, or polymerized, in a sequence that codes for the
					structure of proteins and other biological molecules. The DNA in one of your
					microscopic cells contains a sequence of almost 3 billion nucleotides!
