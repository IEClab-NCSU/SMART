In fact, organisms are so well adapted to their environments that humans are now looking to
			them for inspiration. Today, a fast-growing field called biomimicry brings biologists
			together with engineers to develop new products based on solutions found in nature. One
			of the earliest products of this approach was the invention of Velcro (the hook and loop
			attachment) by Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral. He was inspired by the burrs that got
			stuck in his dogâ€™s fur. To learn more, visit the  Biomimicry Institute.
