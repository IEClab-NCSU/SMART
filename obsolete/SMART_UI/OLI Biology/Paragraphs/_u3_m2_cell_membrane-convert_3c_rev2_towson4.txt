Three Na+ ions from inside the cell bind to the transporter.
A molecule of ATP binds to the transporter, providing the energy needed to change
				the shape of the transporter. This allows the Na+ to cross the membrane and exit the
				cell, against its concentration gradient.
Two K+ ions from outside the cell bind to the transporter.
The transporter changes shape again, bringing the K+ into the cell.
