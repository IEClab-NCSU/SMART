Every cell has ribosomes, but each organismâ€™s ribosomes are built
            according to a slightly different set of specifications. Here, then, is a characteristic
            that we can compare and contrast among every single living species. That is just what
            Carl Woese, a microbiologist at the University of Illinois, set out to do in the 1970s.
            He obtained gene sequences for ribosomes of a wide range of species. He focused on part
            of the small subunit, shown above for one species of heat-loving bacterium. Amazingly,
            he could line up matching gene sequences (long series of the nucleotide bases A,G,C,T)
            among various microbes, plants, animal, and fungi. This was painstaking work, done
            without the aid of modern computers and software.
