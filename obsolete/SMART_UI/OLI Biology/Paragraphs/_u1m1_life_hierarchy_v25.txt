Some organisms consist of just one cell and include unicellular organisms such as
					bacteria and protists. Single-celled life forms are typically referred to as
						microorganisms. Other organisms consist of many cells working
					together. These multicellular organisms include animals, land plants, and most
					fungi. Most multicellular organisms have cells that are specialized to carry out
					specific functions. Tissues are formed when many different kinds of cells work together
					to fulfill the same detailed function. Organs are collections of tissues that work
					together to carry out a common general function. Organs are present not only in
					higher level animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of
					organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have many
					organ systems. For example, the circulatory system transports blood through the
					body and includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual
					living entities that survive and reproduce as a unit. For example, each tree in
					a forest is usually an individual organism.
