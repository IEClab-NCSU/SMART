Now that you understand the basics of DNA replication, we can add a bit of
            complexity. The two strands of DNA have to be temporarily separated
            from each other; this job is done by a special enzyme, helicase, that helps
            unwind and separate the DNA helices. Another issue is that the DNA
                polymerase only works in one direction along the strand (5’ to 3’), but the
            double-stranded DNA has two strands oriented in opposite directions. This problem is
            solved by synthesizing the two strands slightly differently: one new strand grows
            continuously, the other in bits and pieces. Short fragments of RNA are used as primers for the
                DNA polymerase.
