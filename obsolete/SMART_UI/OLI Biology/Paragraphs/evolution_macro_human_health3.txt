            to learn that the familiar daffodil is a plant with medicinal potential. Although
            daffodils are poisonous, drugs might be developed from chemicals that can be extracted
            from the plant. One wild daffodil species in Spain (Narcissus
                confusus) has been found to contain a chemical that slows the progression of
            Alzheimerâ€™s disease and another that inhibits replication of HIV, the AIDS virus.
