If there is a defect in either of the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, that will result in increased
			chances of DNA errors, which ultimately can increase the likelihood of cancer. BRCA
			genes are therefore considered tumor suppressor genes. Mutations
			in these genes produce a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome in affected
			families.
