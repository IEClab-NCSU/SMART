The genetic code is redundant; some amino acids are specified by multiple codons. This
					redundancy will become important when we try to predict how changes in
					nucleotide sequences affect the amino acid sequences of proteins. Remarkably,
					the genetic code table is almost universal, meaning that most organisms, from
					bacteria to humans, specify the same amino acids using the same codons. As a
					result, genes from one type of organism can be transferred to, and expressed in,
					the cells of another organism. You will learn more about these kinds of
					technologies later in this unit.
