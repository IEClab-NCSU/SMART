After transcription a “5’cap” is added to the transcript. This “cap” is a GTP that is added through the 5’ position of the GTP to the 5’ end of the transcript. This results in a free 3’OH of the guanine nucleotide on the 5’ end of the transcript. As we will see in the next unit, the 5’-cap is a signal used in binding the eukaryotic message to the ribosome to initiate protein synthesis. 
A second post-transcriptional modification is the addition of a “polyA tail” onto the 3’ end of the transcript. A specific enzyme adds 100 to 500 adenine nucleotides to the 3’ end. Once the mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, it is thought that the polyA tail acts as a clock to measure the lifetime of the message. A 3’- exonuclease is an enzyme that removes nucleotides one at a time from the 3’ end. If one assumes that it removes nucleotides at a constant rate, the message can be actively used from 3 minutes to 4-5 hours, depending on the length of the tail, before it becomes inactive due to the loss of the “tail.”
