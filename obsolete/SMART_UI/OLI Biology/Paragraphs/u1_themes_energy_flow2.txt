Humans and other consumer must eat or absorb complex food molecules derived from
                    the bodies of other organisms. Food provides nutrients; we get the building
                    blocks for our bodies from the food we consume. Food also provides chemical
                    energy (calories) that can be used for movement, growth, etc. Producers
                    such as plants do not eat or absorb complex food molecules. Instead, they
                    absorb very simple nutrients like water and carbon dioxide gas. They then use
                    energy from sunlight to make their own food from these simple nutrients. All
                    organisms - both consumers and producers - process foods and absorb useful
                    energy and building blocks. The leftovers are released as simple wastes to the
                    environment. The atoms that make up matter are very durable and they flow in an
                    endlessly repeated cycle between producers, consumers, and the nonliving
                    environment.
