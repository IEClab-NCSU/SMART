People have been grappling with questions about the origins of life for nearly as long as
            we have been in existence. Every society has addressed these questions based on the
            information that was available at that time and place. Before the Scientific Revolution,
            people used many different sources of information to answer questions about the origins
            of life. Some of their ideas were based on direct observations, but many of them
            involved supernatural beings or spiritual forces. Stories were told to explain how the
            world and humans were made, but also to address questions of meaning: why the world
            exists and what human life is “for.” Ideas were passed down as oral tradition (myth and
            folklore) or in the written documents of organized religions. Scientific study is much
            more narrowly focused on close examination of processes and objects in the natural
            world. In order for an explanation to be considered scientific, it must be based on
            verifiable observations. It must be possible to test it through observations or
            experiments. Ideas or explanations that do not meet these criteria are not necessarily
            “bad” or “wrong,” but they are unscientific.
