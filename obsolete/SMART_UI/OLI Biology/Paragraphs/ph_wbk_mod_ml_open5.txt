For our studies, the Bronsted definition of  an acid will be used,  we will define an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor.  Hydrochloric acid, like sodium chloride, is a strong electrolyte because it completely dissociates in aqueous solution into charged ions.   Hydrochloric acid is also a strong acid because when it completely dissociates it also completely donates all of its protons.
