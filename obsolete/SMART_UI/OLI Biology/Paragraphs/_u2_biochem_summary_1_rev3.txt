Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. The hydrogen
                    bonds formed between water molecules give water some important properties that
                    enable life. One such property is the polar nature of
                    water, which makes it a good solvent for other polar compounds, like glucose.
                    Hydrophobic nonpolar compounds do not interact with water because of hydrophobic
                    effect; the ordering of water molecules around the dissolved nonpolar molecules
                    is very unfavorable.
