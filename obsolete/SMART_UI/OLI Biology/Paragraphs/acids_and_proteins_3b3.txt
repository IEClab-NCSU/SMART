You can often recognize that a protein is an enzyme by its name. Many enzyme names end with
			“-ase.” For example, the enzyme lactase is used to break down the sugar lactose, found
			in mammalian milk. Other enzymes are known by a common name, such as pepsin, which is an
			enzyme that aids in the digestion of proteins in your stomach by breaking the peptide
			bonds in the proteins.
