Ecologyâ€™s greatest application is the study of environmental problems and solutions.
            Human activities change how biogeochemical cycles operate on a global scale. Population
            size, affluence, and use of high-impact technologies all contribute to our impacts. Use
            of renewable resources and biodegradable materials can help make our activities more
            sustainable. Human populations have exploded during the Industrial Age because of
            improvements in public health. Today the global population exceeds 7 billion and many of
            us enjoy a high standard of living supported by energy and materials derived from fossil
            fuels. Human activities tend to degrade biodiversity through habitat destruction,
            species introductions, overharvesting, and pollution. Anthropogenic global climate
            change is emerging as a critically important effect of humans on the environment. By
            2050, Earth may be home to about 10 billion increasingly affluent people. Innovative
            green technologies, restraints on consumption, and measures to control population growth
            all may help to limit our impacts on the environment.
