Genes carry the information required to produce a functional
            product (protein or RNA). The information is contained in the order of bases in the DNA.
            This information is “read” by the cell to produce, first RNA, and then a protein, during
            a process called gene expression. When a protein affects an
            observable characteristic of an organism (remember, observable characteristics represent
            an organism’s phenotype), the gene encoding that particular protein can be linked to
            that characteristic or character (e.g.,
            hair color, eye color, or height). Traits are specific
            variations in characteristics (e.g., black hair or blue eyes). For example, the gene
            encoding growth hormone (a protein) affects the height of an individual; in this case,
            height is the characteristic, and tall or short stature are the traits. Some genes can
            be linked to the development of diseases. Nearly all observable characteristics depend
            upon multiple genes. Therefore, when we hear someone refer to the “obesity gene,”
            “Alzheimer’s gene,” “breast cancer gene,” and so on, it is important to realize that
            these labels imply (or should imply) one of the multiple genes that contribute to each
            of these conditions.
