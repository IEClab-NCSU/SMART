In the remainder of this Unit, you will continue to explore some of the basic
					principles of biology. First you will explore the difference between living and
					non-living things. You will also see how biology “zooms” in and out, looking at
					life on a huge range of levels from atoms to the global environment. You will
					begin to see how all living organisms are built from smaller components that
					combine to form larger more complex systems. You will also be introduced to the
					common themes of biology, concepts that appear over and over again throughout
					the course. Last, we will learn about some of the key tools, ideas, and
					problem-solving methods that are used by biologists to ask and answer scientific
					questions about life. Many of these ideas will be applied in a final section
					exploring the use – and misuse – of antibiotics.
