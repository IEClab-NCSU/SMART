ATP, the
					molecule with the higher energy content, can react to form ADP + P. This chemical
					reaction can also be reversed and, in so doing, cells replenish ATP. ADP + P can
					combine to form ATP, a reaction referred to as a condensation
							reaction since two molecules are condensed into one. We know
					the first reaction (ATP → ADP + P) releases energy. Therefore, the second
					reaction (ADP + P → ATP) requires energy. The opposing reactions are like using
					and charging a rechargeable battery. When you use the energy stored in the
					rechargeable battery, it is like using up ATP (ATP hydrolysis). When you
					recharge the battery, you must put energy in (by plugging it into the electrical
					socket). This is like ATP formation, which is usually fueled by chemical energy
					extracted from sugar or fats.
