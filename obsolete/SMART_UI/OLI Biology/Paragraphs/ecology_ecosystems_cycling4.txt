Organismsâ€™ needs are met through continuous recycling of chemical elements.  Direct biotic cycling occurs when producers use wastes excreted by consumers; urine contains nitrogen and phosphorus compounds that can act as plant fertilizer.  Cycling also occurs through decomposition.  When an organism dies, its macromolecules are broken down by bacteria or fungi and the elements are returned to soil, air or water as simpler compounds.  Physical processes (weather, formation and erosion of rocks, etc.) also transform and transport elements.  Biogeochemical cycles are the pathways that chemical elements follow through ecosystems; they involve life (bio) and nonliving components (geo) .
