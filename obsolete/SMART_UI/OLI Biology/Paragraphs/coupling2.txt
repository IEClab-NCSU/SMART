A reaction will be spontaneous in the forward direction if the Gibbs free energy for that
      reaction is less than zero. The same reaction, if run in the reverse direction, will have a
      positive Gibbs free energy and will therefore be non-spontaneous. If it is necessary to
      reverse the direction of this reaction to reverse the direction of the pathway, then the sign
      of the GIbbs free energy for the reverse reaction has to become negative. If you recall, the
      Gibbs free energy:
