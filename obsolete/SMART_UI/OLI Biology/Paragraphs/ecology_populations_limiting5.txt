Sometimes limiting factors act in an unpredictable way to reduce population sizes. Hard
			freezes, fires, droughts, and floods are all examples of factors that could act to
			quickly reduce a population. These factors most strongly affect small-bodied organisms
			that are easy to kill such as insects, microbes, and weedy plants. Their populations
			often show an erratic boom-and-bust pattern: population sizes shoot up when times are
			good and crash when conditions are bad. Ecologists agree that it is difficult to predict
			or model the changes in such populations, except by taking into account the weather or
			other outside factors known to control them.
