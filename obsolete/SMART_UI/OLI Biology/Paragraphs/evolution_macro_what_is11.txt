In the early 1700s, Carolus Linnaeus established the modern system for naming and
            classifying organisms. In it, species are placed in nested groups based on their shared
            characteristics. Species correspond to biological lineages. Higher levels of
            classification are the genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Each level is
            nested within the next higher level; all members of a genus, for example, are members of
            the same family, order, and so on. Below, the Linnaean hierarchy is shown for the
            Roseate Spoonbill.
