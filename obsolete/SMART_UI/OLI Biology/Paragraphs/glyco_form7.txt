 It should also be noted that while the transformation from the alpha to the beta form of
			an individual carbohydrate at the anomeric carbon is freely reversible and dictated by
			equilibrium, that freedom of conversion is lost once the anomeric carbon is involved in
			a glycosidic bond. Furthermore, the condensation/hydrolysis reaction is generally
			written as an equilibrium; however, the glycosidic (acetal) linkage is very stable and
			does not spontaneously break (hydrolyze) without the input of energy and the use of a
			specific enzyme. The stability of the glycosidic bond contributes to the effective use
			of the polysaccharides in maintaining structure.
