 Now we will build larger aldoses by adding one carbon at a time to the structure. In
			doing this, two components will remain unchanged, the aldehyde group will always be the
			number one carbon and the bottom or last two carbons will always represent the D form of
			the carbohydrate (monosaccharide).
