The size, polarity, and charge of a substance will determine whether or not the substance
			can cross the cell membrane by diffusion. The cholesterol was an example of a lipid, and
			is highly soluble in the nonpolar environment of the lipid bilayer. You saw, in the
			animation above, the cholesterol freely passing into the hydrophobic environment of the
			membrane. Cholesterol distributes freely in the membrane and then some fraction will
			dissolve in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. Water, on the other hand, while
			polar, is small enough to cross the membrane at a slow rate. Note that specialized
			transport proteins in certain cell membranes can provide a channel for the water,
			greatly increasing its rate of crossing the membrane. The lipid bilayer is much less
			permeable to the ion, because of its charge and larger size. As a general rule, charged
			molecules are much less permeable to the lipid bilayer.
