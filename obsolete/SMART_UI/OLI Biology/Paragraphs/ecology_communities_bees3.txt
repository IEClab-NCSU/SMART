Even the gory interaction with decapitating flies probably cannot explain colony collapse
			disorder all by itself. Instead, experts agree that many factors have likely worked
			together to threaten bees. As we learn more about the habitat needs of bees and threats
			to their existence, we may be able to find ways to protect them. In this way, biologists
			hope to reinforce the ancient mutualism between bees, crop plants, and food
			producers.
