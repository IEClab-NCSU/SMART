Your trillions of cells are intimately dependent on each other for survival. Your
                    cells are specialized and your life requires a massive team effort. If any one
                    of your major organs were to suddenly fail, you might die very quickly.
                    Moreover, your health also depends on trillions upon trillions of bacterial
                    cells that live in your large intestine and on other moist surfaces throughout
                    your body. They provide your cells with vitamins, help keep out invaders, and
                    may even influence your mood. So your body itself is a community of
                    interdependent cells.
