While maintaining a pH close to neutral is usually the goal of homeostasis, there are certain
			conditions and parts of organisms that are maintained at a lower (more acidic) pH. For
			instance, the process of digestion is aided by the presence of stomach acid (pH 2). Not
			only does stomach acid help to break down the compounds in our food, it also helps to
			prevent disease by killing many of the bacteria and viruses found in food and water.
			Lysosomes, digestive organelles found in eukaryotic cells, have an internal pH of about
			5. Again this acidic environment is used to break down cellular food, waste, and even
			invading bacteria. Likewise, the surface of our skin is acidic (pH of 4.5 to 6), which
			helps to support the growth of our normal bacterial flora, as well as to help prevent
			the growth of pathogenic bacteria.
