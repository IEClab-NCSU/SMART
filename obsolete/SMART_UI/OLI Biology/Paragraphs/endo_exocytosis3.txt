While facilitated diffusion and active transport account for a great deal of the specific
			uptake of molecules and ions needed by the cell, other sources of external matter can
			also be taken up by the cell. The channels and pores provide a means by which molecules
			can pass directly through the membrane to the cytoplasm. Other mechanisms also exist by
			which molecules are taken up by the cell but do not directly pass through the plasma
			membrane. This mechanism is referred to as endocytosis. This mechanism involves the
			engulfing of the matter by the plasma membrane and internalization of the engulfed
			material inside a cytoplasmic vesicle. Non-specific uptake of molecules occurs by
			phagocytosis (large particles and macromolecules) and pinocytosis (water soluble small
			molecules).
