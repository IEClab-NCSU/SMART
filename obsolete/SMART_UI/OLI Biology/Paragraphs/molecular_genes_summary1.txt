The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of information from DNA
                    to protein. In this module you learned about transcription and translation. You
                    also learned about mutations (changes in the DNA sequence) and how to predict
                    their effects. At the end we discussed a real life example in which genes and
                    environmental factors interact to produce an important health outcome (breast
                    and ovarian cancer).
