The shape of the ligand matches the shape of the ligand binding pocket on
						the protein. The better the match, the stronger the bond between the ligand
						and the protein.
Any charges on the ligand molecule can be aligned close to opposite charges on the
				protein's binding site. Remember, opposite charges attract each other.
Hydrogen bonds often form between the ligand and the protein binding site.
Nonpolar ligands bind more favorably to nonpolar surfaces on the protein.
