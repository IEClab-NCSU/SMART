Factories often have assembly lines that put together the companyâ€™s
							product. In the cell, proteins and other cellular
							components are put together, or assembled, by the endoplasmic
									reticulum (ER), a series of sacs and tubes. In
							eukaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the
							"rough ER," which gets its name from the beaded appearance that the
							ribosomes give it. The smooth ER (without ribosomes) can have different
							functions depending on the cell type, but it is often the site for the
							synthesis of lipids.
