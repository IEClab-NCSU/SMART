An attractive force generated by the interactions between ions of
                                opposite charges. An ionic bond forms due to an attraction between a
                                positive and a negative ion. No electron sharing occurs in the ionic
                                bond. In the formation of an ionic bond, electrons are said to be
                                transferred from one atom to another.
