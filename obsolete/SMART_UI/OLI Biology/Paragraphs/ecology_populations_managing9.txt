Population management can also raise ethical issues. It involves life-and-death decisions
			that can be very emotionally charged. At Valley Forge NHP, park managers recognized the
			need to act as deer populations climbed past 1,000 and serious ecological damage began
			to occur. The parkâ€™s plant diversity was severely threatened by the high deer numbers;
			few tree seedlings or wildflowers were able to survive except within small fenced areas
			(deer exclosures).
