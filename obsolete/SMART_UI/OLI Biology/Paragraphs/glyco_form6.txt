 While all linkages between the anomeric carbon of one carbohydrate and every hydroxyl of a second carbohydrate are possible, it is important to understand, that in biological systems, very little is left to chance, and in fact, every reaction that takes place in a cell is catalyzed by an enzyme. Just as we
			have stated that bioselectivity dictates that D carbohydrates are used by biological
			systems, the formation of glycosidic bonds is catalyzed by specific enzymes that direct
			the formation of specific glycosidic bonds between the anomeric carbon of one defined
			carbohydrate and a specific hydroxyl function of a defined second carbohydrate.
			Each
			resulting disaccharide is a different structure. This is another example of
			bioselectivity.
