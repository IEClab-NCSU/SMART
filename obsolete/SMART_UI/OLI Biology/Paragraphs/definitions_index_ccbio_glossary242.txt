(plural, nuclei) The word nucleus is used in two different contexts
                                in the study of biology. Loosely defined, nucleus means "center" or
                                "core." Here, in a study of basic chemistry, nucleus means "the
                                    center of an atom." In this case, the nucleus is a
                                central area in which the atom’s heavy particles (protons and
                                neutrons) are packed close together. When discussing cell structure,
                                the word nucleus refers to the central organelle of the eukaryotic
                                cell. It consists of the cell’s DNA enclosed in a double-layered
                                membrane and can be thought of as the “command center” of the
                                eukaryotic cell.
