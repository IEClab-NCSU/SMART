The carbon-containing molecules used as cellular fuel are broken down and
						converted to carbon dioxide (CO2).
Electrons and hydrogen ions (H+) are
						produced as sugar is broken down and energy is harvested; oxygen
							(O2) combines with these byproducts to produce water
							(H2O).
The energy released when carbon-containing molecules are broken down
						is captured and used to generate ATP molecules; some
						energy is also lost as heat.
