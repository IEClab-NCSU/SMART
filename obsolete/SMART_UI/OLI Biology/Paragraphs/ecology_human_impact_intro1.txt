In the past, the science of ecology focused on nonhuman species. Rather than
            studying cities or farms, ecologists have worked in “wild” places like forests,
            mountain streams, coral reefs, and grasslands. Ecologists sought to unravel how
            plants and animals in these places interacted with each other. The activities of
            humans were viewed as a separate issue, outside the normal set of processes at work
            in “natural” communities and ecosystems.
