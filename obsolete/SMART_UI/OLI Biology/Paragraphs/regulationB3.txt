At least one step is regulated, often in multiple ways.
Essentially irreversible steps, i.e. those with large energy changes, are regulated.
        Consequently, once the pathway is turned on, metabolites that enter the pathway are
        committed to complete the pathway.
In synthetic and degradative pathways a common step is performed by different enzymes,
        each of which are regulated in a coordinated fashion such that only one pathway is on at a
        time.
