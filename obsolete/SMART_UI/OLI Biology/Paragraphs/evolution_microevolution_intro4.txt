There are two defining aspects to a population. A population is strictly composed of
			members of the same species. For example, a population would always consist of people
				or of grizzly bears, but never of both people and grizzly bears. Second, the members of a population occupy
			the same area. Scientists define the area based upon the problem they are studying. In
			evolutionary studies, biologists try to define populations based on actual patterns of
			breeding, so that individuals most often breed within their population groups; migration
			and mixing between populations is less frequent.
