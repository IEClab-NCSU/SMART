The last type of RNA molecule that is critical for translation is ribosomal RNA
					(rRNA). rRNAs are components of the ribosome. The ribosome is a large
					macromolecular complex composed of rRNA and ribosomal proteins. The ribosome
					catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids. Some ribosomes
					are located in the cytosol and translate cytosolic proteins. Some ribosomes are
					attached to membranes; these ribosomes translate proteins destined to be
					inserted into the membrane or secreted outside the cell.
