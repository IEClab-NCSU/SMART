The story of acids and bases begins with water (H2O). Water in the
					liquid state is highly dynamic. Not only are hydrogen bonds constantly forming
					and breaking between water molecules, but individual water molecules are
					breaking apart and then reforming again to make water. When they break apart, a
					hydrogen ion (H+) is transferred to another water molecule to make a
					hydronium ion (H3O+), leaving a hydroxide ion
						(OH-) from the original water molecule. This dynamic reaction can
					be represented by this chemical equation: H2O + H2O
					 H3O+ + OH-.
