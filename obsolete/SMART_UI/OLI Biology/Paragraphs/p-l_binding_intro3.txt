 The reversible binding of the protein ligand complex is critical. For example, hemoglobin
      binds to oxygen in the lungs and releases it in the tissues. If oxygen were unable to
      dissociate from hemoglobin, the tissues would be starved of oxygen. Likewise, proteins act as
      signal receptors by binding to signaling molecules, such as hormones, to propagate the signal
      into a cell. If binding were permanent, there would be no way to terminate the signal.
