Gregor Mendelâ€™s experiments that you studied earlier involve simple dominance, in
                    which the offspring will show a trait from either one parent or the other, not a
                    blend of those traits. In a case of simple dominance, crossing a red flower and
                    a white one will produce a red flower, not a pink flower. If you think about
                    traits that children inherit from their parents, you will realize that this does
                    not always happen.
