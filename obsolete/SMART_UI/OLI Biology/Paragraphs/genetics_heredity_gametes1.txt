When you studied meiosis, you learned about how gametes were formed. But how are
                    alleles dispersed into gametes through the process of meiosis? This activity
                    will help you answer that question as you review the essential components of
                    meiosis needed to understand inheritance. You may wish to review the
                        Meiosis 
                    module prior to continuing with this unit.
