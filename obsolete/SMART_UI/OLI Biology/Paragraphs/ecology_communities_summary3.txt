Natural communities are home to thousands of species; each species may interact
                    directly with hundreds of others. Moreover, species can also participate in
                    indirect interactions; in such cases the two species do not contact each other
                    directly, but they affect each other through a chain of cause and effect.
                    Therefore ecological communities are exceedingly complex.
