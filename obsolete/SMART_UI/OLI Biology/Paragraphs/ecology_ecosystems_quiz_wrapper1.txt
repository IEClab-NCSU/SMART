Living things do not live in isolation. Nonliving factors in the environment,
					such as sunlight, rain, gases in the air, and chemicals in the soil can affect
					the ability of organisms to survive and are called abiotic factors. Ecosystems
					include producers, organisms that can use energy from sunlight to synthesize
					their own food molecules. Other organisms, classified as consumers, must eat
					producers or other consumers. Feeding relationships among the members of the
					ecosystem form a food chain, starting at the lowest level with the producers and
					moving to primary and secondary and tertiary consumers. Energy flows through the
					ecosystem, dissipating as heat with each transfer. Chemicals, by contrast, are
					recycled. Biologically important chemicals such as water, carbon, nitrogen, and
					phosphorus cycle between the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem.
