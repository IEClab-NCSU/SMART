Phospholipids serve a major function in the cells of all organisms: they
							form the phospholipid membranes that surround the cell and intracellular
							organelles such as the mitochondria. The cell membrane is a fluid,
							semi-permeable bilayer that separates the cell's contents from the
							environment, see animation below. The membrane is fluid at physiological
							temperatures and allows cells to change shape due to physical
							constraints or changing cellular volumes. The phospholipid membrane
							allows free diffusion of some small molecules such as oxygen, carbon
							dioxide, and small hydrocarbons, but not charged ions, polar molecules
							or other larger molecules such as glucose. This semi-permeable nature of
							the membrane allows the cell to maintain the composition of the
							cytoplasm independent of the external environment.
