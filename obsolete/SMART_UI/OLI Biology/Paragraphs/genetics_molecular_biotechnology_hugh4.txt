More recently, proteins used for medical treatment are produced in yeast or cultured
            mammalian cells that are grown in synthetic growth media. Protein production in yeast or
            mammalian cells avoids the possibility of having toxic bacterial impurities in the final
            product. The overall steps in producing the protein in yeast or mammalian cells are very
            similar to the steps described here, however the overall cost of producing the protein
            may be somewhat higher.
