The degree of unequal electron sharing depends on the difference in electronegativity of the
			atoms involved in the bond. For example, in carbon-carbon bonds, both atoms have the
			same electronegativity, so the electrons are equally shared between the two carbons. In
			contrast, a carbon-oxygen bond involves two atoms that have different
			electronegativities. The less electronegative atom (carbon) will donate part of its
			electrons to the more electronegative atom (oxygen), resulting in a partial positive
			charge on the carbon (indicated by δ+) and a partial negative charge
			on the oxygen (indicated by δ-). The size of the partial charges is
			proportional to the difference between the electronegativities of the two bonded atoms.
			Bonds in which electrons are unequally shared between the atoms are called polar covalent
			bonds.
