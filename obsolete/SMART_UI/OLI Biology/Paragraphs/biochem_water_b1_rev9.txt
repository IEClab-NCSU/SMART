When a non-polar molecule dissolves in water it becomes completely surrounded by
					water molecules. The water molecules cannot form hydrogen bond with the
					non-polar molecule, however they do form hydrogen bonds with the other water
					molecules that surround the non-polar molecule, forming a layer of hydrogen
					bonded water molecules that cover, or form a cage, around the dissolved
					non-polar molecule. A representation of these water molecules organized around
					dissolved butane is shown in the following Jmol:
