Human activities have affected biodiversity for thousands of years. In fact,
                    human hunting is one probable cause for the extinction of many large animal
                    species that ended about 10,000 years ago. We may never know for sure if humans
                    caused the demise of the woolly mammoth or the saber-toothed tiger, but we can
                    be quite sure that our activities severely threaten many species today. Tracking
                    and clarifying this problem is a major challenge for ecologists. Below is a
                    diagram showing how many species are threatened (or already extinct) among some
                    well-studied groups of plants and animals.
