Cells in living organisms have two basic requirements: energy and carbon. Cells
					require a source of high-energy electrons to produce chemical energy and a
					source of carbon-containing molecules that can be used to synthesize proteins,
					fatty acids, and other molecules. The principle source of energy for all
					organisms on earth is the sun. This light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic
					organisms such as plants and algae and used to convert carbon dioxide
						(CO2) to glucose and oxygen during
							photosynthesis. The end result is that the energy
					from the sun has been stored in glucose, a small six-carbon carbohydrate. The
					oxygen and glucose are then available to other living organisms. Humans (and all
					other organisms, including plants) use glucose as food, and release the energy
					in glucose through a process called respiration. We
					usually think of respiration as the act of breathing preformed by many organisms
					to take in oxygen. However, in cells, respiration more specifically is the
					process of breaking down large molecules (nutrients, such as glucose) into
					simpler molecules including some of the energy released and stored as chemical
					energy in the molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
					There are two types of respiration: aerobic respiration requires
					oxygen and anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen. A commonly
					known form of anaerobic respiration is fermentation, the process
					used to produce wines, distilled liquors, and other products.
