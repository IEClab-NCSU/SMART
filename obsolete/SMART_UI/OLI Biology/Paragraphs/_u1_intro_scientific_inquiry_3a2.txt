To avoid this situation, experimenters make sure that their subject groups are as similar
            as possible in all variables except for the variable that is being tested in the
            experiment. This variable, or factor, will be deliberately changed in the experimental
            group. The one variable that is different between the two groups is called the
            independent variable. An independent variable is known or hypothesized to cause some outcome. Imagine
            an educational researcher investigating the effectiveness of a new teaching strategy in
            a classroom. The experimental group receives the new teaching strategy, while the
            control group receives the traditional strategy. It is the teaching strategy that is the
            independent variable in this scenario. In an experiment, the independent variable is the
            variable that the scientist deliberately changes or imposes on the subjects.
