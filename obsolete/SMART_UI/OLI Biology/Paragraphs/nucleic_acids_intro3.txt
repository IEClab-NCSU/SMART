A nucleic acid consists of a chain of nucleotides. There are different kinds
            of nucleotides that can be linked to build the different nucleic acids. DNA is probably
            the most familiar nucleic acid, but in this module, you will also learn about RNA. The
            nucleotides that are used to build RNA molecules are different from the nucleotides that
            are used to build DNA. You'll also take a look at a very special nucleotide â€”
                ATP, which acts as the energy currency of the cell.
