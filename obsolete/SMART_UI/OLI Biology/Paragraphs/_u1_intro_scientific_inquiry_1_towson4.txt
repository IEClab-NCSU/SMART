Once a scientist has made a significant discovery or has gathered data to enhance what is already
					known, that scientist will communicate these findings by publishing their work in a peer-reviewed
					journal. Peer review is considered the hallmark of scientific communication. Before a paper is
					published, it is read and critiqued by other scientists. Peer review is one way scientific information
					is scrutinized before it is accepted as a part of mainstream science.
