To decrease the pH inside of the lysosome, the concentration of protons will need to be
			greater inside the lysosome than in the cytoplasm. To accomplish this protons will need
			to move from a low concentration to a high concentration. This is a non-spontaneous
			process and requires the cell to do work to move the ions up-hill against the gradient.
			To do work, the cell must expend energy and actively move (pump) the ions. This process
			is referred to as active transport. The source of energy for this process in most
			biological systems is the hydrolysis of ATP.
