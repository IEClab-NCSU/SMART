Microevolution occurs when the type or
			frequency of the alleles and genotypes in a population change over one to many
			generations of time. But what does that actually mean? Let's
			look at a hypothetical example. We’ll observe two different populations of foxes, one in
			Maryland and one in Wisconsin. We’ll narrow our focus to a single gene with two alleles
			that determine coat thickness. And we will visit the populations at two different
			times.
