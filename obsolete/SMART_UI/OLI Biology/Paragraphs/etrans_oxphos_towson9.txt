Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred to oxygen, generating
            water.
Electron transport is spontaneous and releases energy. This energy is stored by
            transporting protons across the inner membrane.
Oxidation of NADH results in 10 protons transported across the inner membrane.
Oxidation of FADH2 results in 6 protons transported across the inner
            membrane.
