In this module we will use all of the concepts previously introduced in the section on
			biological chemistry to study the interaction, or binding, of small molecules to
			proteins. If the small molecule binds to a protein, but undergoes no further changes,
			then it is referred to as a ligand. If the molecule binds to the protein, and
			then is changed by a protein-catalyzed chemical reaction, the small molecule is referred
			to as a substrate, the resultant altered compound is the product, and
			the protein becomes an enzyme. Although ligands and substrates are usually
			small molecules, proteins themselves can be ligands and substrates for other
			proteins/enzymes.
