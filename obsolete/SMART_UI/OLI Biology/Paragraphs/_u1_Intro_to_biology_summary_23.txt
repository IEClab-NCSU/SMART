Even life itself is an emergent property. When atoms and molecules are organized in a
			particular way, a living (biotic) cell is generated that is capable of growth and
			reproduction. The properties of tissues and organs emerge from interactions among cells;
			tissues and organs combine to form an organism; and multiple organisms give rise to
			populations, communities, and complex ecosystems.
