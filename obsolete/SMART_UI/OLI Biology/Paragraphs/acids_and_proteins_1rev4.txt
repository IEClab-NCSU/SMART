The main-chain atoms of glycine are highlighted in yellow and its side chain (H)
					is highlighted in green. All amino acids have the same main-chain atoms, but
					differ in the side chains. For clarity, the hydrogen is omitted in the remaining
					drawings. 
Nonpolar amino acids
					are highlighted in gray, 
Aromatic amino acids
					are highlighted in cyan,
Polar amino acids are
					highlighted in purple,
Amino acids with acidic side
						chains are highlighted in red, and
Amino acids with basic side
						chains are highlighted in blue. 
The amino acids cysteine and proline, which are shown at the bottom of the page,
					have unique properties. Cysteine can form covalent S-S disulfide bonds,
					stabilizing the protein structure. In the case of proline, the side chain
					attaches to its own nitrogen, making proline an amino acid.
