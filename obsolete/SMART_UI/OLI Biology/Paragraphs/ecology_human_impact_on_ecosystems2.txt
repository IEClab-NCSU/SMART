A continuing increase in Earth’s ocean and land surface temperatures since the early
            1900s is known as global warming. The phrase “global warming” may leave the false
            impression that the Earth simply gets a bit cozier over time as this process continues.
            Earth’s climate is a complex system. As the climate warms, temperatures are not evenly
            adjusted upward by a fixed number of degrees across seasons and locations. Instead, we
            are also seeing many dramatic weather anomalies in recent decades, including strong
            hurricanes and tornadoes, protracted droughts, unusually severe heat waves, and even
            record snowfalls. Instead of global warming, some like to say we are experiencing
            “global weirding.” Anthropogenic global climate
                change is a more appropriate description of how climate is responding to human
            activities on a global scale. It is the full range of climatic disruptions that have
            occurred as a probable result of human alteration of the atmosphere. In other words, it
            is recent climate warming—and weirdness—that is probably caused by humans. The case for
            global climate change can be summarized as follows:
