The Punnett square below represents a dihybrid cross for Labrador retrievers,
                        similar to the one that you saw in the previous module. Based on the given
                        genotype of the offspring and that Labradors exhibit polygenic inheritance,
                        drag the corresponding phenotype that goes with each genotype.
