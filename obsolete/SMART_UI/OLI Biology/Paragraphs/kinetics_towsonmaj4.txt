 Enzymes bind to substrates in a manner similar to the way myoglobin binds oxygen
					or the estradiol binds to the estrogen receptor, but enzymes can go one step
					further. In this case the ligand is specifically referred to as the
						substrate (the molecule that the enzyme will convert to product)
					and it binds to a specific binding region of the enzyme referred to as the
						active site. Once bound, the ligand, or substrate, can either
					simply reversibly come off the enzyme, or it can be converted into a new
					compound or product. The general form of the reaction is: E +
						S <=> [ES] -> P + E 

					Where E = enzyme, S = substrate, ES = the enzymeâ€¢substrate complex, and P =
					product. The square brackets around the ES complex indicate that the complex is
					inferred, because it is very unstable and generally not directly measurable.
