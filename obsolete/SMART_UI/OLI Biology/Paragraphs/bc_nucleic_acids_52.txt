DNA structure is an antiparallel double helix: the two DNA strands run in opposite directions.
			The sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside, and the bases are on the inside of the
			helix. The two strands are held together by base pairing: hydrogen bonding between
			specific bases. Adenine (a purine) always pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine); guanine (a
			purine) always pairs with cytosine (a pyrimidine). These base pairing rules (A-T, G-C)
			are very important to the structure and function of DNA.
