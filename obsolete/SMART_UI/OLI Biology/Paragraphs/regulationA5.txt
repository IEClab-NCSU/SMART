Substrate availability. For many enzymes, the intracellular level of substrate is
        below the level that half saturates the enzyme. Therefore, if the substrate concentration
        increases the rate of the reaction will increase due to the formation of additional
        enzyme-substrate complexes. If the substrate concentration is very low, the increase in the
        rate of the reaction is almost equal to the increase in substrate concentration.
Product inhibition. In this case the product of the reaction inhibits the enzyme
        that generated it, preventing the accumulation of intermediates in a pathway. The product is
        a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme that just created it.
