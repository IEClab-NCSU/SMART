Life is organized into hierarchical levels of increasing complexity. The study of
					biology involves all these levels, from single atoms or molecules up to global
					relationships among organisms and the environment. As we ascend through this
					hierarchy to more and more complex levels, emergent properties appear. These are
					characteristics of a system that are not present in any of its component parts.
					Take, for example, an automobile. The separated parts of the automobile amount
					to a heap of junk. Only when properly assembled, with gas, the right key, and a
					human driver, does the car fulfill its function, which is to transport us from
					place to place.
