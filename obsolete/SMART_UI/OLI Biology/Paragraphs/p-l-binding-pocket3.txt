M + O <=> [MO] 
	
			This equation describes an association of
			two molecules. In the previous analysis of weak electrolytes we wrote the dissociation
			of a weak acid as the taking apart of a molecule that was bound by a weak covalent bond.
			While there are no covalent bonds being formed during the association of oxygen and
			myoglobin, there is the same type of equilibrium established between the association of
			myoglobin and the dissociation of the weak acid. Thus, where we used a Kd (K) as a
			constant that defined the strength of the weak electrolyte's ability to retain its
			proton, it is also possible to define the affinity of the ligand for the protein by a
			constant referred to as the equilibrium constant, Keq. For the association reaction as
			it is written above, the equilibrium constant would be expressed as follows:
