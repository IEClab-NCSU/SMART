Cells live in dynamic environments. Therefore, it takes work to keep conditions stable in a
			cell. Precise regulation enables the cell (or body) to establish consistent internal
			conditions. Factors like pH, ion concentrations, and levels of various substrates and
			products are held within narrow bounds. This unique environment allows a diverse set of
			reactions to take place. Many of these chemical reactions are essential for life and all
			of them help maintain overall health.
