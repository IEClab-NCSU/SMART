Long-term heritable changes can be produced by the environment at the level of
                    DNA. Any environmental influence that can damage DNA has the potential to create
                    mutations that can result in changing amino acid sequence of a protein or
                    regulatory information. For example, high-energy radiation causes
                    double-stranded breaks in DNA that can lead to deletions. UV light causes single
                    nucleotide changes in DNA. Environmental toxins and viruses also cause
                    mutations. Cumulative DNA damage in somatic cells throughout an organismâ€™s
                    lifetime contributes to the aging process. Only mutations in germ cells result
                    in heritable changes passed on to the next generation of offspring.
