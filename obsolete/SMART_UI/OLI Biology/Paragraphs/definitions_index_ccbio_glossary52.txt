A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction, but is not itself
                                chemically-altered in the process. A catalyst increases the rate of
                                a reaction, by decreasing the activation energy required for the
                                reaction to take place. Enzymes are biological catalysts that
                                mediate the conversion of substrate to product, by lowering the activation
                                energy of the reaction. Enzymes re not consumed or modified during the
                                process. Enzymes are generally made of proteins but nucleic acid enzymes,
                                ribozymes, have also been discovered.
