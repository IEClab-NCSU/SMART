Life requires energy to accomplish its anabolic reactions. This energy cannot be “made” from
					nothing, because energy cannot be created or destroyed. But energy can be
					transferred and transformed. Energy that is available to the cell must somehow
					be packaged in useful form and delivered where it is needed. This problem is
					solved through chemical transfers of energy from catabolic reactions to energy
					carriers and then from the energy carriers to the substrates that are joined in
					anabolic reactions.
