Agricultural Age. This age started around 10,000 years ago.
            It involved many (though not all) human cultures worldwide and extended through
            the late 1700s. People began to domesticate plants and animals. Food supplies
            became more reliable and abundant and diets expanded to include grains, poultry,
            meat and dairy products from livestock, improved fruits and nuts, and more.
            Agricultural Age humans stayed close to productive farms and pastures and built
            the first permanent towns and cities. Humans began to extract and forge metal to
            make durable tools, weapons, and ornaments. Energy sources expanded to include
            labor from farm animals such as oxen and horses. Windmills and water mills were
            also used as a source of power. Some cultures developed extensive water control
            systems for irrigation of crops. Governments, organized religions, and written
            languages flourished.
