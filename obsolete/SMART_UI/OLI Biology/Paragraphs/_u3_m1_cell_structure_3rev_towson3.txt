Eukaryotic cells are complex and organized into membrane-bound compartments,
					called organelles, that perform specialized functions.
					Organelles carry out specialized tasks such as energy production, protein
					synthesis, reproduction, and processing of nutrients and waste. The various cell
					types differ in the arrangement, number, and structure of organelles.
					Additionally, the number of organelles of each type in a given cell varies
					depending on the function of the cell.
