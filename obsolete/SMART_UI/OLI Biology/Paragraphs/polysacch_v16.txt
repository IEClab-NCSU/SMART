A third disaccharide that provides a transition to the common
		polysaccharides is maltose, a homo-disaccharide. The structure is a
		homo-dimer made up of two molecules of glucose linked by an alpha-1, 4 glycosidic bond.
		Maltose is commonly found as a dietary supplement and naturally is produced as an
					intermediate breakdown product of starch. As such it also represents the basic repeating
					unit of the polysaccharides starch and glycogen.
