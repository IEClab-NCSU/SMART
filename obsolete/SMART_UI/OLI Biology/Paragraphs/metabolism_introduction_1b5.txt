 The first part of the process of respiration is called
						glycolysis. It consists basically of the breakdown of glucose into a smaller
						compound called pyruvate. Pyruvate can then go on to either cellular
							respiration or fermentation, depending on the
						availability of oxygen. Glycolysis will occur if the cell requires energy.
