Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition that affects the respiratory and digestive
			systems in children and adults. While there is no cure for the condition, in the 1950â€™s,
			people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis were lucky if they lived long enough to go to
			elementary school. Medical research has made an enormous difference in the life
			expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis, and today, they routinely live into their
			thirties and forties.
