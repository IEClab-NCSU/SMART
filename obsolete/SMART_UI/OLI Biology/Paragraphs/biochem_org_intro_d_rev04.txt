Functional groups in this category are also referred to as hydrophobic (water-hating) groups. They only contain carbon and
					hydrogen, and lack electronegative atoms such as
					nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Molecules containing these functional groups tend
					to be insoluble; that is, incapable of dissolving in water or only slightly
					soluable with great difficulty. Nonpolar functional groups are often found on
						amino acid side chains of proteins, and they also make up a
					major part of most lipid molecules. The hydrophobic nature of nonpolar
					functional groups often affects the shape of molecules containing these groups.
					For example, proteins will fold so that nonpolar groups are
					clustered together and are not in contact with water. Some lipids bury the
					nonpolar section of the molecule by forming lipid
					bilayers, which shape the boundaries of all cells.
