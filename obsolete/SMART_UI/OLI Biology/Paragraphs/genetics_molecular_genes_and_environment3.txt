Cells and organisms have to respond to changes in their environment. An organism
                    that experiences a sudden increase in temperature will respond with increased
                    expression of genes coding for heat-shock proteins; these proteins protect cells
                    from damaged and unfolded proteins. A bacterial cell that depletes glucose in
                    its environment will not die of starvation if an alternative energy source is
                    available. In the presence of lactose, bacteria can "turn on" the lac operon
                    containing genes required for metabolism of lactose. Regulation of this operon
                    will be discussed in detail on the next page. The signaling occurs primarily
                    through binding interactions between molecules and modifications of the proteins
                    that often lead to changes in gene expression. These changes are short-lived and
                    are not heritable.
