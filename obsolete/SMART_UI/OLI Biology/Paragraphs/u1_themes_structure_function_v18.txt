 Structo is just a blob floating in the ocean, and it needs a structure that will
				allow it to exchange gases between its blood and the surrounding water. It cannot
				breathe through simple diffusion of gases across the surface of its body, like a
				jellyfish or sponge is able to do. Instead, it needs a specialized structure to help
				it breathe.
