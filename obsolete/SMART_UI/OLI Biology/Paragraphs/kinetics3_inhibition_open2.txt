 Left alone, enzymes would deplete a cell of all the substrates. In some cases, this may
			be desirable, such as enzymes that degrade old, worn-out proteins. In other cases, there
			may be multiple uses for a substrate and depletion, by one enzyme, may be detrimental to
			the working of a cell. In some cases, such as the digestion of food, the enzyme needs to
			be functional in the gut but not in the cell. Thus, several types of regulations have
			evolved that the cell can use to control enzyme rate.
