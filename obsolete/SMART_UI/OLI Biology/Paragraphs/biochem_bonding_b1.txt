Ionic bonds are the interactions between ions of opposite charges. Atoms form ions
			when they either take up or release electrons in order to fill their outer shell.
			Elements in the outer columns of the periodic table often react in this manner; elements
			like sodium tend to lose electrons and become cations (positively charged ions), whereas
			elements like chlorine tend to gain electrons and become anions (negatively charged
			ions).
