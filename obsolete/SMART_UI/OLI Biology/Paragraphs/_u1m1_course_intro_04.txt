Understanding biology can help us understand ourselves and the environment around us. For
			example, understanding how climate change affects ecosystems will help identify the ways
			in which sustainable food production can keep up with a growing human population.
			Biological research is constantly adding to our understanding of human health and
			disease, and often results in treatments that lead to longer, healthier, and more
			productive lives. Biological research can also help address the growing demand for
			renewable energy and sustainable resource use.
