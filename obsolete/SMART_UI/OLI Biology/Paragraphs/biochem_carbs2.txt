Carbohydrates can also be used as structural building materials.
						Cellulose is an example of a complex carbohydrate used in
					plants for structural support. Within plant cell walls, cellulose molecules form
					chains that provide high tensile strength. In some plants, cellulose is also
					included in a secondary cell wall, which adds rigidity and waterproofing. This
					helps tree bark, plant leaf stalks, and other structures resist wind and other
					physical forces in the environment.
