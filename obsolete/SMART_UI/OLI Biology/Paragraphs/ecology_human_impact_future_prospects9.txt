If these trends continue and spread globally, humanity may be able to limit some
                    of its future environmental impacts through technological progress. However, new
                    and more sustainable green technologies are not guaranteed to succeed. They are
                    usually developed first in industrialized nations and their use may be limited
                    by cost. Ultimately, green technologies will reduce our collective environmental
                    impact only if they are widely used. To have a large effect, they must be
                    adopted widely in industrialized nations and then quickly transferred to the
                    fast-growing and populous nations of Asia and Africa. Major public and private
                    investments may be needed to meet this goal.
