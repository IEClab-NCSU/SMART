While doctors and scientists have made great strides in combating HIV, the “war” on this
			virus is far from over. In 2010, there were approximately 34 million people infected
			with HIV worldwide and 1.8 million deaths associated with HIV. Rates of HIV infection
			and the death toll from AIDS are disproportionately high in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
			other areas without access to HAART. Even in wealthier nations, the problem of drug
			resistance continues. As of 2009 researchers were tracking 93 different common
			drug-resistance mutations worldwide. Today the World Health Organization (WHO) and other
			groups are working to raise HIV awareness, reduce infection rates, and increase access
			to drugs among those already infected. Researchers are also working to develop new drugs
			and vaccines.
