Functional groups are parts of organic molecules that have specific properties or
			functions. Because organic molecules can contain more than one type of functional group,
			a particular molecule may have multiple properties. Identifying functional groups in
			molecules is an important skill because once you identify a moleculeâ€™s functional
			groups, you can predict many aspects of its biological behavior.
