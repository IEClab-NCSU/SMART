Enzymes are proteins that have the ability to bind substrate in their active site
			and then chemically modify the bound substrate, converting it to a different molecule â€”
			the product of the reaction. Substrates bind to enzymes just like ligands bind to
			proteins. However, when substrates bind to enzymes, they undergo an enzyme-induced
			chemical change, and are converted to products.
