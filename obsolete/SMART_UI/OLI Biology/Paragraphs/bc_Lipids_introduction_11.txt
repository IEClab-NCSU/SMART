Lipids are a diverse group of macromolecules united by their hydrophobic,
			nonpolar nature. We are most familiar with the lipids known as fats. Fats
			are used to store energy for later use. They also provide structural support and
			cushioning for many animals. Some dietary fats are healthier than others. In this
			module, you will learn about the differences between saturated,
				unsaturated, and trans fats.
