Instead of transferring their electrons completely, atoms may remain in very close
			contact and share electrons so that their outer shells are filled. In essence, a shared
			electron is counted “twice” and participates in a larger shell that joins the two atoms.
			A single pair of shared electrons makes a single covalent bond. Atoms can share two
			pairs of electrons (in a double bond), or even three pairs of electrons (in a triple
			bond).
