For transfer-RNA (tRNA), the RNA transcript has a segment of the 5’ end removed, a
      trinucleotide that is common to all tRNAs (ACC) added to the 3’ end, and a short segment of
      RNA spliced out of the middle of the RNA sequence. In addition, several of the bases in the
      structure are chemically modified after the final sequence is generated.
