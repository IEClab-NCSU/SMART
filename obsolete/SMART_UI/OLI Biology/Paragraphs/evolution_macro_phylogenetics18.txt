Unlike many physical or behavioral traits, DNA sequences are an excellent source of data
            on relationships. By looking at DNA, biologists have a way to directly and objectively
            compare inherited information. For example, virtually all eukaryote species have a
            gene in their mitochondria that codes for cytochrome C oxidase, an enzyme that is vital
            to the process of aerobic respiration. This widespread gene is quite similar in most
            species, but mutations do occur and tend to be preserved within a lineage. Subunit 2 is
            a portion of the cytochrome C oxidase protein; its gene is composed of about 700
            nucleotide base pairs. What does this gene say about the relationships among Carp,
            Salamander, Sea Turtle, Human, and Mouse? The image below gives a glimpse of the
            data.
