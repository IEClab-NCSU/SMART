In this inheritance pattern, called incomplete dominance, the
                    heterozygous genotype exhibits an intermediate phenotype. In the snapdragon
                    example, the intermediate phenotype is pink. What is the difference between the
                    purple heterozygotes of the pea flowers and the pink heterozygotes of the
                    snapdragon flowers? Think about what an allele is: a variation of a gene
                    containing the recipe for a protein. In the flower color example, this protein
                    could be an enzyme involved in the synthesis of a pigment. In the case of the
                    pea plant, the presence of a single allele in the heterozygous plant was enough
                    to provide all the pigment needed to give the dominant purple color. However, in
                    the case of the snapdragon, the presence of only one allele does not provide
                    enough pigment to give the flower a fully red hueâ€”but there is enough pigment to
                    tint it partially, thus providing the pink color of the heterozygous flower.
