In any real-world example, many, many variables MIGHT affect the outcome of an
            experiment, yet only one or a few independent variables can be tested. Other variables
            must be kept as similar as possible between the study groups and are called control
                variables. For our educational research example, if the control group consisted
            only of people between the ages of 18 and 20 and the experimental group contained people
            between the ages of 30 and 35, we would not know if it was the teaching strategy or the
            students' ages that played a larger role in the results. To avoid this problem, a good
            study will be set up so that each group contains students with a similar age profile. In
            a well-designed educational research study, student age will be a controlled variable,
            along with other possibly-important factors like gender, past educational achievement,
            and pre-existing knowledge of the subject area.
