Polar functional groups contain electronegative atoms like
					nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S). The presence of electronegative atoms
					in a functional group results in an unequal distribution of electrical charges
					on the atoms, causing the bonds to become polar. Because polar bonds interact
					favorably with water, compounds with polar functional groups also interact
					favorably with water, making them hydrophilic, or water-loving.
						Biomacromolecules containing these functional groups dissolve in
					water. In addition to interacting favorably with water, the polar atoms can also
					participate in chemical reactions and polar functional groups are usually
					responsible for the catalytic properties of enzymes.
