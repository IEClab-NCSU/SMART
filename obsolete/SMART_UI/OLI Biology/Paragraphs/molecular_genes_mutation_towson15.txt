Below you are given a sequence in the middle of the DNA template for the normal
				(wild-type) hemoglobin gene. Also given is the amino acid sequence and the amino
				acid position; notice how each is aligned to the DNA template sequence. In humans, a
				mutation can occur in this gene resulting in a change in the hemoglobin amino acid
				sequence, and ultimately, a change in the protein shape and function. This mutation
				caused a disease called sickle cell anemia. You are shown the same sequence of
				template DNA for the mutated, sickle cell, sequence. Analyze both sequences and
				answer the questions below.
