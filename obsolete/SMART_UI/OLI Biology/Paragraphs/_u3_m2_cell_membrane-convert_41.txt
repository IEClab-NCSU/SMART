While facilitated diffusion and active transport account for a great deal of the specific
			uptake of molecules and ions needed by the cell, other sources of external matter can
			also be taken up by the cell. The channels and pores provide a means by which molecules
			can pass directly through the membrane to the cytoplasm. Other mechanisms also exist by
			which molecules are taken up by the cell but do not directly pass through the plasma
			membrane. This mechanism is referred to as endocytosis. This
			mechanism involves the engulfing of the matter by the plasma membrane and
			internalization of the engulfed material inside a cytoplasmic vesicle. Non-specific
			uptake of molecules occurs by phagocytosis (large particles and
			macromolecules) and pinocytosis (water soluble
			small molecules). Cells are also capable of recognizing specific particles and
			internalizing them in the same way, a process called receptor
					mediated endocytosis. In this case the particle first
			binds to a membrane protein receptor on the surface of the cell and the binding which
			induces the engulfment of the material bound to the membrane.
