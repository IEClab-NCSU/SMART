 The nervous system transmits signals to different parts of the body to
                    coordinate function. Electrochemical signals are processed in the brain and sent
                    down the spinal cord, which runs the length of the back. From the spinal cord,
                    peripheral nerves send signals out to the extremities. Return signals come in
                    through sensory nerves and either return to the spinal cord for processing or
                    back to the brain. The spinal cord processes reflexes and repeated patterns.
