The energy that fuels most ecosystems comes from the sun. Photosynthetic
				producers such as plants are found in trophic level 1. Organisms in level 1
			do not consume other living organisms to obtain nutrients. They can make simple organic
			food molecules from inorganic raw materials using light energy from the sun. Plants,
			algae, and cyanobacteria are the photosynthetic producers that make up trophic level 1
			in most ecosystems. Organisms in level 2 and beyond are called consumers
			because they obtain food by eating plants or by eating organisms that have eaten plants.
			Animals, fungi, and many microbes are consumers. Consumers are identified as primary,
			secondary and tertiary depending on their trophic level. Cows eat grass and are primary
			consumers. When you consume a salad, you too are acting as a primary consumer. Humans
			who eat meat from cattle act as secondary consumers.
