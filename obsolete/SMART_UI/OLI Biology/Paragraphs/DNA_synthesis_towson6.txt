As single stranded DNA is generated between the ‘back’ of the RNA primer on one strand
            and the opening replication fork, a new segment of RNA primer is laid down near the
            opening fork and DNA polymerase synthesizes a new complementary strand of DNA from the
            primer toward 5’ end of the existing primer and stops. This segment of DNA that is not
            connected to the next segment is referred to as an Okazaki Fragment. Synthesis
            on this lagging strand is said to be discontinuous since it is
            generated in uniform lengths of DNA starting from one primer and stopping before the
            next RNA primer. 
Synthesis on the opposite strand is a continuous uninterrupted process starting from
            the initial primer and continuing as long as the DNA continues to open up at the
            replication fork. This strand on which continuous synthesis takes place is
            referred to as the Leading Strand.
