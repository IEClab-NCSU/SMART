Fermentation breaks down organic molecules and stores energy as ATP.
                                Fermentation reactions do not require oxygen, and they do not break
                                down all glucose fully to carbon dioxide. Instead, they end with
                                organic molecules that still contain considerable chemical potential
                                energy. Such pathways produce only a tiny amount of ATP compared to
                                aerobic cellular respiration.
