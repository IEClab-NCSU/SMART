Cells may find themselves in three different sorts of solutions. The terms isotonic,
			hypertonic, and hypotonic refer to the concentration of solutes outside the cell
			relative to the solute concentration inside the cell. In an isotonic solution, solutes
			and water are equally concentrated within and outside the cell. The cell is bathed in a
			solution with a solute concentration that is similar to its own cytoplasm. Many medical
			preparations (saline solutions for nasal sprays, eye drops, and intravenous drugs) are
			designed to be isotonic to our cells. A hypotonic solution has a low solute
			concentration and a high concentration of water compared to the cell's cytoplasm.
			Distilled (pure) water is the ultimate hypotonic solution. If a cell is placed in a
			hypotonic solution, it will tend to gain water. The solutes will "stay put" within the
			cell, but water molecules will diffuse such that their net flow is toward the area with
			a higher concentration of solutes. A hypertonic solution has a high solute concentration
			(lower water concentration) compared to the cell cytoplasm. Very salty or sugary
			solutions (brines or syrups) are hypertonic to living cells. If a cell is placed in such
			a solution, water tends to flow spontaneously out of the cell.
