Overall, the global population will continue to increase for at least a few
                    decades, and this increase will be driven mainly by growth in the low- and
                    middle-income nations of Africa and Asia. Experts predict that fertility will
                    continue to fall in most nations as they develop economically, as contraception
                    becomes more available, and as educational and economic opportunities for women
                    improve. If so, the world population is projected to peak at around 9 to 11
                    billion in 2050 and begin to decline thereafter.
