There is a great diversity among living things.  Biology is a study of the diversity and the commonalities of living organisms. Living and 
			nonliving things are made of matter.  What distinguishes living things are their need for energy, their ability to grow and reproduce, 
			their response to environmental stimuli and their ability to evolve.  All living organisms share the same levels of organization and the 
			levels move from the simple to more complex.  Organisms are made from the same set of building blocks, atoms, which combine to form molecules.  
			Small molecules are brought together to form more complex biological macromolecules.  The next level of organization is the organelle.  Atoms, 
			molecules, macromolecules and organelles form cells, the smallest unit of life.  The most complex and all encompassing level is the biosphere.  
			The levels of organization are depicted in the figure below:
