Ice and permafrost melting. The extent and thickness of
                    floating sea ice in the Arctic has declined in recent decades. Based on
                    satellite data, the area covered by thick multiyear ice decreased by about half
                    between 1980 and 2012. A majority of mountain glaciers are also shrinking in
                    thickness and area over time. Perpetually frozen soils (permafrost) have been
                    melting to increasing depths each summer in the Arctic. Such changes have many
                    implications. Sea ice is important to the ecology of polar bears and other
                    arctic animals; it acts as a platform for travel and foraging. Mountain glaciers
                    supply summer melt water to major river systems in Asia and elsewhere; glacier
                    retreat may reduce the reliability of water supplies for irrigation and other
                    uses. And melting of permafrost leads to landslides and releases additional
                    greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
