In this unit we will begin by studying the atom and the subatomic particles that form the
			atom. We will then discuss the way atoms combine to form molecules through chemical
			bonds. We will take a closer look at water, whose unique properties make it a very
			important molecule in living systems. Finally, weâ€™ll examine the concept of pH and
			discuss its implications for life.
