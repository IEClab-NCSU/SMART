A specialized structure within a cell formed when a specific set of
                                molecules bond, creating a subunit that has a specific function.
                                Most, but not all, organelles are enclosed by a membrane. In
                                eukaryotes, organelles are membrane-bound compartments that contain
                                specific groups of macromolecules that carry out specific cellular
                                functions. Although, prokaryotes are less complex than eukaryotes,
                                they contain subunits (non-membrane bound structures) that perform
                                specific functions, such as the flagellum and the ribosome.
