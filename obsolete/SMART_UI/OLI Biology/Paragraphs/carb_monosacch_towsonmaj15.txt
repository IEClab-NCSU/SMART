 Now letâ€™s represent the ribose structure as it is actually found in solution. As
			previously mentioned, compounds will spontaneously form 5 or 6 member rings if possible.
			For aldoses this is possible because of the reactive character of the aldehyde group.
			For ribose this means that if the oxygen on the number 4 carbon forms a bond with the
			number one aldehyde carbon and the hydrogen on the hydroxyl shifts to the carbonyl
			oxygen on the aldehyde the result is a five-member ring referred to as a furanose.
