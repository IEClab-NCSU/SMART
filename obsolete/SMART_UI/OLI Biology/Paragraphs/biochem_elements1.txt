Youâ€™ve already seen that all atoms have a few structural
			characteristics in common. All atoms have a nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons, and are
			surrounded by electrons. However, you are probably also aware that not all atoms are the
			same. In fact, atoms come in different types, called elements. There are 92
			different kinds of elements that are naturally occurring on Earth. Each
				element has its own set of properties that are unique to atoms of its
			kind. Elements are designated by either one- or two-letter abbreviations
			and they can be organized into a chart called the periodic table. We will take
			a closer look at the periodic table (also called the periodic chart) later
			in this unit.
