Amphipathic molecules are molecules that have a distinct non-polar, or
					hydrophobic region, and a distinct polar region. These molecules do not form
					true solution is water. Rather, the non-polar parts are forced together into a
					non-polar aggregate, leaving the polar part of the molecule to interact with the
					aqueous phase. Detergents and long-chain carboxylic acids are examples of
					amphipathic molecules.
