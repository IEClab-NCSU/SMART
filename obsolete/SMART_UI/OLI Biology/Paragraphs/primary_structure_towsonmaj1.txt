    		A protein is composed of amino acids attached in a linear order. This basic level of protein
    			structure is called it's primary structure and derives from the formation of peptide
    			bonds between the individual amino acids.
    			The order of the amino acids is determined by information encoded in the cell's genes. An
    			example of a protein sequence is shown below where the one letter abbreviations are used for each of the 20 amino acids used in cellular protein synthesis.
