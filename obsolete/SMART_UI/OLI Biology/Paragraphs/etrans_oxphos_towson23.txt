Complete rotation of the 

 subunit requires the transfer of 9 protons across the membrane. This generates a
          total of 3 ATP molecules since there are three ADP/ATP binding sites on the F1
          domain, one associated with each 
-
 subunit. Consequently, only three protons are required to synthesize one
          ATP.
