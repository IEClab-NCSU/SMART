You have probably seen Siamese cats--those graceful creatures with darker fur on their
            faces, tails, and paws. This is an example of a phenotype dependent on the interaction
            between genes and environment. Modern Siamese cats have a defective tyrosinase enzyme;
            tyrosinase is involved in the synthesis of melanin, the dark pigment of the skin. This
            defective enzyme is inactive at normal body temperatures, but it becomes active in
            cooler areas of the skin. This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the
            body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air
            through the sinuses.
