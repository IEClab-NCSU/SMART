The linear chain of amino acids will spontaneously fold into a three dimensional
					shape, which is usually the active form of the protein. For example, look at the
					drawing of the three dimensional structure of myoglobin (shown on the left). You
					can manipulate the 3D structure using the Jmol image on the right.
