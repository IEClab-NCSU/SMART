Humans and other organisms that undergo sexual reproduction produce specialized
					reproductive cells called germ cells which are the precursors of
						gametes (called sperm and egg in many organisms including humans).
						[The term "germ cell" used here should not to be confused
						with the common term “germ” meaning infectuous microorganisms.] When
					the gamete from one individual fuses with the gamete from another individual, a
						zygote is formed. In sexually reproducing organisms, gametes are
					produced through a process called meiosis which will also be discussed
					in a later module. In organisms that are diploid, gametes are produced using a
					different process than somatic cells. Mitosis and meiosis are the agents of cell
					division and growth; their role in human growth is summarized in the diagram
					below.
