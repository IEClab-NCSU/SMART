Binding the ligand is based on energetically favorable non-covalent interactions, such as
      hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Since the binding is
      non-covalent, the protein ligand binding is reversible, and the bound ligand can dissociate.
      This is represented in the following reaction diagram:  M + L <=>
        [ML]
        
 The protein is represented as M (macromolecule) and the ligand as L. The double
      half-arrow is used to illustrate that M and L can associate and, once bound, can dissociate.
      The bound state is represented as ML and is enclosed in brackets to indicate that the complex
      is unstable.
