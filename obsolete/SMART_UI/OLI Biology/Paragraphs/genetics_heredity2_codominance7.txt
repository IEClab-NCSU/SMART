Patients homozygous for the defective allele have sickle cell anemia.
                    Heterozygotes (having one “good” and one “bad” allele for hemoglobin) will
                    present both types of hemoglobin. That condition is called sickle cell trait,
                    where the individuals will present many red blood cells that become sickled
                    under conditions of extreme physical exertion or low atmospheric oxygen. So
                    while the phenotype can be considered intermediate, in fact it is actually a
                    case of codominance. Interestingly, the sickle cell trait protects against
                    malaria infection, and therefore remains prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where
                    malaria is endemic.
