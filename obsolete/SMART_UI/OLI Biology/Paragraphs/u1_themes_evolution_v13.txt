According to evolutionary thinking, life forms are similar because of their
                    shared ancestry. All cells have DNA as the molecule of inheritance and they also
                    share many other detailed features. Organisms and cells always come from
                    parents, and this is where they get their genetic information. Trace this
                    process back in time, and it is reasonable to suppose that all life forms
                    inherited DNA and many other features from a long-ago common ancestor. The unity
                    of life is very striking when we examine molecules, which can be almost
                    identical in species as different as bacteria and whales. This unity of
                    structure and function is also evident when we compare skeletons, kidneys, or
                    hearts among animals.
