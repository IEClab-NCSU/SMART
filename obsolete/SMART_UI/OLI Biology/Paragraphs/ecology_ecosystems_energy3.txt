Transfer 1: sunlight â†’ tomato plant.  Most of the sunlight energy that reaches the plant is reflected or absorbed and re-emitted as heat.  Some is captured by photosynthesis.  Most of this is used by the plant for aerobic respiration and ATP generation; ultimately this energy is released as heat.  Only about 1% of the incoming solar energy is stored as calories in the molecules within the tissues of the growing plant.
