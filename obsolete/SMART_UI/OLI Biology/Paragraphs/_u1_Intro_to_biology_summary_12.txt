In the past, life was recognized in animals and plants but microscopic life forms were
			unknown. Today, our definition of life centers on the cell. This structure is the basic
			unit of organization for all life forms, large and small. In addition to being made of
			cells, known life grows using raw materials and energy, reproduces using DNA as its genetic material, and senses and responds to changes in the external environment. Viruses,
			because they depend on cells for their reproduction, do not fully meet this definition
			of “life.” Knowledge of bacteria and their cell biology has allowed major advances in
			public health and medicine. For example, we now can selectively use antibiotics to
			control infectious bacterial diseases. These drugs cannot be used against viruses and
			their misuse can lead to the evolution of resistance among bacteria.
