In contrast to the chaos of the outside world, the interior of a cell is a remarkably
            constant environment. For example, cells typically keep their internal pH (acidity)
            within a narrow range. Why is this so important? Recall that enzymes will lose their
            function and many of the chemical reactions of life will not work if cell conditions
            change too much. If the cellâ€™s surroundings change quickly, conditions inside the cell
            may be temporarily disturbed. Organisms react to these changes in a corrective fashion:
            they detect changes and do something to oppose them. When you catch a chill, your
            muscles may contract in rapid bursts (shivering), generating heat that warms you back up
            again. The ability or tendency of organisms and cells to maintain stable internal
            conditions is called homeostasis and is an important theme in biology. The term
            homeostasis comes from the Greek words homeo  (same, alike) and stasis ( standing). It describes how life stands in one
            place despite many changes in the surrounding world.
