Mixed Non-polar/polar molecules:  Of course, there are instances where
					even molecules with electronegative atoms will not be water soluble. Computer
					algorithms are currently used to predict water solubility based on structure.
					For our purposes, we will balance the ratio of polar and non-polar elements in a
					structure to estimate the chemical nature of any compound we are going to study.
