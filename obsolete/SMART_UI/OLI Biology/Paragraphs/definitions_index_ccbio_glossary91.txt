The division of the cytoplasm of a cell at the end of mitosis to form
                                two separate daughter cells. In animals cells, this occurs through
                                the pinching of the membrane at the center of the parental cell
                                while in plants, this occurs through the formation of a cell plate
                                as new cell wall forms to separate the daughter cells.
