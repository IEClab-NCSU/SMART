Biology also helps answer questions about the world around us. Ecologists are
					biologists who specialize in studying the way that living organisms interact
					with their environments. They examine important issues such as acid rain and
					observe what happens to the health of living systems when acid rain falls. There
					are even specialized biologists, called astrobiologists, who study conditions on
					other planets and design experiments to determine whether or not life could
					exist in other places in our solar system.
