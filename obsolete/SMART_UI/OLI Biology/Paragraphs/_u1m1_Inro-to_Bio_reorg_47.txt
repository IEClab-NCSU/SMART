One way to reduce the development of antibiotic resistance is to use antibiotics
					only when necessary, so that there are many antibiotic-free people and places in
					the environment. This makes it easier for vulnerable strains of bacteria to
					reproduce, and keeps these strains more common. Within a sick patient, however,
					the goal of antibiotic therapy is to keep reducing the numbers of harmful
					bacteria until your immune system can kill off the last (and probably most
					resistant) holdouts. Therefore it is important to take antibiotics at full
					dosage and to complete the round of treatment as directed, continuing until it
					is certain that your bacterial foes have been eliminated.
