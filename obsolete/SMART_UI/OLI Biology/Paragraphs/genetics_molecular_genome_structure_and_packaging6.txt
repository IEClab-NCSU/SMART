In general, eukaryotic genomes are much larger than prokaryotic genomes, and they contain
            a lot more noncoding DNA. This presents a problem of packaging for eukaryotic -cells:
            how are they to fit very large DNA into a small compartment? Although eukaryotic DNA is
            supercoiled, this isnâ€™t enough to solve the packaging problem. Eukaryotic cells use
            special proteins (histones) to wind up DNA and fold it into nucleosomes, which are compact structures. DNA can be transcribed in this
            state. Further packaging of DNA into highly compact fibers makes genes inaccessible for
            transcription, leading to gene silencing. Gene silencing is an
            important way of regulating gene expression.
