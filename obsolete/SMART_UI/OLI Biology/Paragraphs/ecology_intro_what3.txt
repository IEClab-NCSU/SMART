Within an area defined by the ecologist, individuals of a single species that
					live together and may breed with each other make up a population. All of the different populations of living organisms
					living within an area make up an ecological community. In
					the example above, the squirrels and sugar maples of a region, together with
					humans plus hundreds of additional populations of plants, animals, fungi,
					bacteria, and other organisms would make up a forest community. The forest ecosystem also includes non-living factors such as
					chemicals in the soil, rainfall and other climate factors, and countless other
					features of the environment that interact with living things in the region.
					Additional ecosystems (lakes, grasslands, oceans, etc.) share our Earth with the
					forest ecosystem. Together, all of the zones of Earth that support life make up
					a giant interconnected system called the biosphere.
