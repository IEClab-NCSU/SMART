Eukaryotic cells grow and reproduce through a series of phases
			called the cell cycle. During interphase the
			cell increases its mass (G1 phase), duplicates its DNA (S phase), and prepares for cell
			division (G2 phase). Certain cells, said to be in phase G0, do not divide further after
			maturing. Many nerve cells (neurons) function this way. If the brain or spine is injured
			the damaged cells are not readily replaced and the injury may be permanent. Most body
			cells can divide. This allows you to replace lost skin cells, for example. During the
					mitotic phase (M phase), the cell divides its nucleus
			(mitosis) and its cytoplasm (cytokinesis) and two identical daughter cells are produced.
			In multicellular organisms, the cells dedicated to sexual reproduction (gametes) are
			produced by a different type of cell division called meiosis.
