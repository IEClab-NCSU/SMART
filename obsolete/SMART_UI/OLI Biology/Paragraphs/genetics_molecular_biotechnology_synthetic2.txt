We will synthesize our HuGH gene using a chemical method called solid-phase synthesis. In
            this method, the first base of our DNA sequence is attached to a small glass bead. The
            next base is then added to the first, and so on, until the sequence is completed at
            which point the DNA is released from the glass bead. Any desired DNA sequence can be
            generated by this method. Current technology limits this approach to about 200 bases. If
            our gene is longer, we have to make it in segments and then join the individual segments
            together.
