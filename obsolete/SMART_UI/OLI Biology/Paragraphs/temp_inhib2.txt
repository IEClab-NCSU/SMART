            The second effect of temperature is to cause proteins to denature. Denaturation means that the protein loses the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure required for function. The protein is held together in part by hydrogen bonds. As with substrate binding, hydrogen bonds are too weak to hold up in high heat.
