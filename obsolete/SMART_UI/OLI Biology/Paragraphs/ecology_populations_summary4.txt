In this module, we looked at the deer population in Valley Forge National
                    Historical Park as a case study in population ecology. When the Park was
                    established and closed off to hunting, the population initially shot up in a
                    pattern resembling exponential growth. It then leveled off when the deer
                    population reached its carrying capacity in the absence of hunting,
                    demonstrating logistic growth. Unfortunately, this produced a density of deer
                    that was harmful to the Park’s plant populations. To protect the Park’s plant
                    diversity, managers used sharpshooters to increase deer mortality and limit the
                    population size.
