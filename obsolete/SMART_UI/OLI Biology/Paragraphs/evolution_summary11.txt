However, scientists are nearly unanimous in their acceptance of the broad ideas of
            evolution as they have been presented in this course. Evidence for common ancestry, an
            ancient Earth, and ongoing adaptation by natural selection is overwhelming and is
            accumulating daily. Improved public acceptance or at least understanding of evolution is
            a goal shared by biologists and educators. You may feel at times that scientists are
            trying to talk you out of your religious or cultural traditions. However, you should
            know that scientists are people and have varied perspectives on religious and
            philosophical matters. Most scientists recognize that not every question can be answered
            by evolutionary thinking. Many find value in religious traditions or other sources of
            meaning even as they embrace the logic and beauty of evolution.
