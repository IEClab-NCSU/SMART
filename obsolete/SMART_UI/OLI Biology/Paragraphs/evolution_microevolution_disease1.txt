Many species have very short generation times ranging from minutes (some bacteria) to a
			few weeks or months (many insects, some weeds). We can track evolutionary changes in
			populations of these organisms. They may change in ways that are important to us. For
			example, disease organisms may shift to human hosts, evolve to evade vaccines, or evolve
			to resist drugs. Pests and weeds may also evolve in ways that make them more harmful or
			harder to control. Scientists and doctors can use what we know about microevolution and
			the mechanisms that drive evolution to help tackle these problems in the “real world”
			not just in the realm of academia.
