An example of the social and cultural nature of science is stem cell research. Stem cell research has been hailed as the source of potential
                    cures for several life-threatening diseases – Alzheimer’s, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Parkinson’s, cancer, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord 
                    injuries. However, some people have moral objections to this type of research because one line of stem cells comes from human embryos. Human 
                    embryonic stem cells (HESCs) are harvested within a first few days of an embryos development. Removing HESCs from the developing embryo destroys it, 
                    thus raising the moral objection to stem cell research on the basis that it ends human life. A second type of non-embryonic stem cells have also been 
                    used in scientific research – these are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from adult tissues. Unlike HESCs, isolating and
                    producing iPSCs from adult stem cells in a lab setting is challenging and methods for doing so are still undergoing investigation.
