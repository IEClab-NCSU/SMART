 The key biologically relevant elements are hydrogen (H), carbon
						(C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorous
						(P), and sulfur (S). These elements represent over 95% of the
					mass of a cell. Carbon is a major component of nearly all biological molecules.
					Some elements are found in relatively small amounts and are called “trace
					elements.” The examples include sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl),
					manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn). Throughout the course you will see how atoms of these
					elements are very important to the functioning of a cell. Living organisms get
					the required elements from outside and constantly rearrange these elements to
					build their own molecules. Thus, understanding behavior and structure of
					elements is important for understanding life.
