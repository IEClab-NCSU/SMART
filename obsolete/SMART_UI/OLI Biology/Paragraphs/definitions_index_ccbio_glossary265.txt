Phylogenetic tree (also called phylogeny), is a tree diagram that
                                represents a hypothesis as to how a biological lineage may have
                                branched and formed clades over time. Remember that as a hypothesis,
                                phylogenetic trees are subject to change as more data are gathered
                                and as analysis techniques improve.
