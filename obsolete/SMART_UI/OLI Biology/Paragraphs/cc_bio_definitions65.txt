Humans reshape the physical structure of ecosystems by clearing forests, suppressing or setting fires, building roads and cities, mining, maintaining croplands, and building water control structures such as dams.  This leads to biodiversity loss.  It may also increase our exposure to forest fires, floods, droughts, soil erosion, landslides, and other physical hazards.
