In contrast to the normal endocytic vesicle the PTD directed endocytic vesicle undergoes
			retrograde transport. In this process the new vesicle fusses with the Golgi and is the
			PTD containing proteins are transported back to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum where
			they undergo post-translational modification and are transduced directly to the
			cytoplasm.
