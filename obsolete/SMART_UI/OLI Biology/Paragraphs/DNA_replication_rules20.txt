 PCR is limited by the length of DNA that can be repeatedly replicated by DNA polymerase.
          Different polymerases and different conditions are described to amplify DNA of varying
          lengths. Routinely, segments of DNA from 500 to 1000 bp in length are easily replicated.
          The segment of DNA to be replicated is defined by the position of the primers that define
          the start of the replication on each strand. These are referred to as the forward
            primer and the reverse primer. The double stranded DNA to be amplified is
          melted by raising the temperature high enough to fully melt the DNA creating single
          stranded DNA. The sample is cooled in the presence of the primers and each primer binds to
          its complementary strand. The appropriate substrate conditions for DNA polymerase binding
          and synthesis are now in place. DNA polymerase is added with the dNTPs and synthesis of
          DNA proceeds for as long as the reaction is allowed to progress before either the time of
          the reaction ends or the DNA polymerase falls off the substrate.
