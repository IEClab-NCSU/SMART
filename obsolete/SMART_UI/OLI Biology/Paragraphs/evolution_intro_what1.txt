In our society, the word “evolution” is used very broadly to mean any kind of change
            (usually for the better). Political views, hairstyles, and technologies all are said to
            “evolve.” In science, the phrase “biological evolution” has a more precise meaning.
                Biological evolution is a change in inherited (genetic) features that
            occurs in populations and higher-level groups over time.
