Carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids are all examples of polymers. These polymers
			are very large molecules composed of smaller units joined by covalent bonds using a
			common set of chemical reactions. Proteins are linear polymers of amino acids all joined
			by peptide bonds. Polysaccharides are the carbohydrates joined through glycosidic bonds
			in sometimes quite complex branched structures. Later in the course you will encounter
			DNA and RNA which are polymers of nucleic acids linked by phosphodiester bonds. This
			unit includes a discussion of the structures of polymers of carbohydrates and of amino
			acids.
