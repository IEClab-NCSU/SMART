The connection between genotype and phenotype of the organism was further discussed in
            the Gene Regulation module. This module began with discussion of gene structure,
            including the parts of the gene required for regulation of gene expression: coding DNA
                sequence, untranslated regions, promoter, operator, and terminator. Comparison of eukaryotic
            and prokaryotic genes and genomes revealed important differences. Many prokaryotic genes
            with related functions reside next to each other on DNA (operons) and are expressed
            together in a single RNA. Eukaryotic genes are often fragmented: exons are interrupted
            by introns, which are removed from the final mRNA. The modular organization of
            eukaryotic genes gives more flexibility in gene expression, because one DNA sequence can
            give rise to different versions of RNA and protein in different cells. The module also
            addressed the interactions between genes and environment. In addition to DNA damage by
            mutagens, environment can affect gene expression directly via regulatory proteins, or
            indirectly by changing packaging of DNA.
