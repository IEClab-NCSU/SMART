Think about this: it is critical that the copies of the DNA are exactly like the original, so
            the daughter cells are identical to the parent cells. There may be changes to DNA
            sequence by mutations (as you will see in another section), and meiosis introduces some genetic
            variability when gametes are produced. But for unicellular organisms or for somatic
            cells, DNA replication is a process that requires high fidelity.
