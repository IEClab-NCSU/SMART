Promoter: Recall from the previous module that in order for
                transcription to begin, RNA polymerase must bind to the correct site. The promoter
                is the DNA sequence, upstream of the structural genes, to which RNA polymerase and other
                initiation factors recognize and bind.
Repressor Gene: Every operon contains a gene that encodes
                one operon-specific repressor. This repressor molecule can bind specific sequences
                in the DNA of the operon to block transcription of the structural genes. This is
                called negative control of gene expression. 
Operator: The operator is an operon-specific DNA sequence which is directly
                downstream of the operon promoter. The operator is the DNA sequence to which the
                repressor can bind to block transcription. A repressorâ€™s interaction with the
                operator is controlled by the binding of a small molecule to the repressor. The
                small molecule is either the compound that enters the pathway (for catabolic, or
                degradative pathways) or the compound that is produced by the pathway (for anabolic,
                or synthetic pathways).
CAP Site: The CAP site, found only in catabolic pathway
                operons, is a DNA sequence that is a binding site for the CAP protein. The CAP site
                and CAP protein are universal to all catabolic operons and not operon-specific. The
                CAP site is located directly upstream from the promoter. The binding of the CAP
                protein to the CAP site is regulated by the level of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the cell.
                When CAP is bound to the CAP site, transcription of the structural genes is turned
                on. This is called positive control of gene expression.
