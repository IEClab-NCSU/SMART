 Cells operate within the laws of chemistry and physics, and utilize only
					chemical reactions that occur naturally.
					Many of
					these reactions are extremely slow, requiring years to eons to complete.
					For example, your favorite book contains paper made of cellulose
					from trees. This paper will take decades to degrade in the environment and
					mammalian systems lack the enzyme that is specific to degrade cellulose,
					however, a bacteria found in the stomach of cows and other ruminants have the
					ability to digest cellulose and provide glucose to the cow. For a cow to survive
					it cannot wait decades to digest a meal of hay. To meet the speed of life,
					chemical reactions in cells are sped up by enzyme catalysts.
