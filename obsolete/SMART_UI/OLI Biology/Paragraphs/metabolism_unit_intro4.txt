The principle source of energy for all organisms on earth is the sun. This energy
					is absorbed by photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and algae and used to
					convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to glucose and oxygen
					during photosynthesis. 
					The end result is that the energy from the sun has been stored in glucose, a 
					small six carbon carbohydrate. The oxygen and glucose are available to other 
					living organisms. Humans (and all other organisms, including plants) use glucose 
					as food, and release the energy in glucose through a process called  
					respiration.  
					The figure below illustrates this process of photosynthesis and respiration. During this process
					the carbon atoms in glucose combine with oxygen to produce CO2; the
					glucose is oxidized, releasing energy. The energy from the
					oxidation of glucose is stored in a small chemical called 
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for immediate use by the cell. 
					ATP is used for almost all of the energy needs of the cell, from the synthesis 
					of other complex molecules to doing mechanical work, such as running. You will learn more of
					these two pathways in “
Anabolic and Catabolic
							Reactions.”
