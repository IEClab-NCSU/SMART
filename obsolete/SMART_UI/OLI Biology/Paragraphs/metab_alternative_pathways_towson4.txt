Some human tissues also use fermentation under certain conditions.
					Sprinters and weightlifters have well-developed fast-twitch muscles. Fast-twitch
					fibers have fewer mitochondria and are not able
					to renew their supply of oxygen rapidly. Therefore, they have relatively poor
					endurance. However, fast-twitch fibers excel at producing strong contractions
					very quickly. They do this using the ATP created through a form of
						fermentation. This pathway does not break sugar all the way
					down to CO2, but stops at an intermediate (lactic acid).
