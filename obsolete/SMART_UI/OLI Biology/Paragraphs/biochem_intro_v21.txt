The cell is the fundamental unit of
			life; therefore, you might think that your study of biology should begin with the cell.
			In fact, before we can understand a complex structure like a cell, we must learn about
			the building blocks from which cells are made. Think back to the 
				Introduction to Biology module in this course, when you learned that all life
			exhibits a hierarchical organization. Cells are the first level of organization that
			display the properties of life; but, their component parts (atoms and molecules) are not
			alive, as illustrated in the inverted pyramid below.
