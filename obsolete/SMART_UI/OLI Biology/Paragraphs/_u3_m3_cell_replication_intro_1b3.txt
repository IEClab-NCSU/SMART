The blobs of clay in the diagram above represent histone protein molecules.
			These proteins associate with DNA in a very precise way. First, they couple with DNA at regularly
			spaced intervals. Notice in the diagram above that the blobs of clay (histones) are
			located at equally spaced intervals along the ruler. Second, they help to wind the DNA
			molecule into an organized and compact structure. The following diagram shows how
			histones wind DNA into a compact structure called a chromosome.
