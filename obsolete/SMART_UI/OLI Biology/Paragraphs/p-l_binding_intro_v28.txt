				The functional groups that are responsible for these interactions are those found in the
			side chains of amino acids, the peptide bonds in the protein and the small molecule
			binding partner. Following some simple rules it is possible to predict how two
			molecules might interact.  In some cases It is also possible to predict how a cell might alter
			physiological conditions to regulate that binding.   You will explore that interactions that stabilize bound estrogen to the estrogen receptor in the following activity:
