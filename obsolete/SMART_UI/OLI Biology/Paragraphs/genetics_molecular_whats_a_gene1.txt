Throughout the genetics unit, we have been using the terms gene, allele, and DNA, along
            with several other related terms. Before we go on, we need to clarify the relationships
            among these terms. First, we need to distinguish between terms that relate to actual
            molecules and terms that relate to the information content of those molecules. The
            macromolecule that carries genetic information is DNA, which in
            the eukaryotic cell binds specialized proteins to create compact structures called chromosomes.
