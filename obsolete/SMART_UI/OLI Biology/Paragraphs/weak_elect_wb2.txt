In this, and following, sections, we will begin to develop a quantitative relationship between the strength of an acid and how the acids ionization state will depend on the pH of the solution.  When placed in water, acetic acid dissociates into the conjugate base, acetate, and a proton. CH3COOH 

CH3COO- + H+

        		
The extent to which the acid will dissociate in pure water is expressed as Ka, the equilibrium constant for dissociation of an acid:
