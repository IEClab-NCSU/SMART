Evolution is a change in a population, not in the characteristics of one individual over
            a single lifetime. As its body temperature, breeding status, and mood change, a lizardâ€™s
            colors may intensify or fade. But this has no effect on future generations of lizards.
            We must broaden our focus to see evolutionary changes: in a population of thousands or
            millions, what percentage of lizards inherit a light color pattern and what percentage
            inherit darker colors? How does this inherited trait change over many generations?
