Asexual reproduction is efficient and fast. However, it only provides one
			set of genes to adapt to the environment. Think about trying to guess a number. Do you
			have a better chance of guessing the number if you get one guess or if you get two
			guesses? Sexual reproduction, in which the genes of two parents are
			combined, results in more genetic variability. This enables offspring to deal more
			successfully with environmental change. However, sexual reproduction is a more complex
			process and results in a smaller number of offspring. Interestingly, certain organisms
			that can reproduce both asexually and sexually will choose sexual reproduction only when
			environmental conditions are not optimal. That way, a smaller number of more variable,
			and thus more adaptable, offspring is produced. In optimal conditions, however, asexual
			reproduction is the favored mechanism.
