Despite their complexity, ecologists have learned a great deal about how
                    communities operate. One helpful strategy is to focus on certain species that
                    play important roles that help to maintain the communityâ€™s diversity and
                    stability. Foundation species make up a large part of the bulk of the community,
                    providing food and physical habitat to many other species. Keystone species, by
                    contrast, are important despite their low abundance or small size. Some of them,
                    like sea otters and gray wolves, are predators that maintain community diversity
                    by keeping certain prey populations in check. We have learned about the
                    importance of keystone species through experiments and also through experience.
                    Hunting or trapping of a keystone species may cause many unanticipated and
                    unintended effects on the community as a whole.
