Science is a process that helps us to understand how the natural world works.
                    When we use the term “natural” in this context, we mean all that can be observed
                    with our senses or with instruments that extend our senses. The “natural” world
                    studied by science can be reliably observed and measured, from the far reaches
                    of outer space to the man-made chemicals in our air and water. This module will
                    examine the process of science and explore how science has led to an increased
                    understanding of living organisms.
