 Another demonstration of bioselectivity is at play in the discrimination between cellulose and amylose by our digestive system. The structural difference between the beta-1,4 link in cellulose and the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond in amylose is sufficient to require different enzymes to break (hydrolyze) the bonds separating the glucose subunits in each structure. The difference is significant because it prevents humans from being able to use cellulose as a glucose source, while we are able to use glycogen and starch. Humans do not posses the enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-1,4 link in cellulose.
