Climate change adaptation is the effort to make humans and
                    ecosystems less vulnerable to the effects of ongoing and future climate change.
                    To reduce the consequences of climate change, we can develop crops that are
                    better adapted to a warmer and drier world; improve irrigation systems to
                    compensate for expected droughts; protect coasts from rising sea levels with sea
                    walls or with buffer zones of natural vegetation; improve emergency response
                    systems and preparedness; and deliberately move people, plants, and other
                    species to areas where the climate is likely to be more tolerable in the future.
                    Scientific assessments help to predict future changes and test the effectiveness
                    of adaptation strategies.
