FAD/FADH2, is a cofactor that is tightly bound to the enzymes in
            the electron transport complexes.
Iron-sulfur centers in the electron transport complexes shuttle electrons by
            alternating between Fe+2 and Fe+3.
Coenzyme Q is an organic non-polar electron carrier that is dissolved within
            the membrane lipids of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It carries electrons between
            complex I and III and complex II and III.
Cytochrome C is a heme containing protein that is very similar in structure
            to myoglobin. It is a water soluble protein found in the inter-membrane space.
            Cytochrome C carries one electron at a time from complex III to complex IV.
