A diet rich in saturated fats may contribute to formation of plaques in the arteries
			(atherosclerosis) and increase your risk of heart disease. To reduce this risk, it is
			recommended that you replace some foods rich in saturated fats (e.g. fatty cuts of pork,
			beef, and high-fat dairy products like butter) with foods that provide unsaturated
				fats (available in foods like olive oil, canola oil, seafood, and walnuts).
			Such a shift is believed to help improve blood cholesterol levels and may reduce your
			risk of cardiovascular disease.
