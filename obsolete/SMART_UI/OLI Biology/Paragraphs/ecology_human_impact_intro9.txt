Over time, human activities may have permanent negative effects on the
            environmentâ€™s capacity to support life or provide resources to future
            generations. Ultimately the degree and nature of our impact will depend on how
            population size, affluence levels, and technologies change in the future. We
            will explore these issues in more depth in this module. In the next page, we
            will examine the history of the global human population, tracing some of the
            factors that have enabled our dramatic expansion in numbers and in impact.
