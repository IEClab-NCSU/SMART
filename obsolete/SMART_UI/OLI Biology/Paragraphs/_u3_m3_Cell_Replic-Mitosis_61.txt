During anaphase the kinetochore proteins break down the microbules attached to them and
			the connections between each copy of the chromosome will be broken down. This causes the
			individual chromosomes to move to opposite poles of the cell. The root “ana-” refers to
			“apart” because the chromosomes are moving apart from each other.
