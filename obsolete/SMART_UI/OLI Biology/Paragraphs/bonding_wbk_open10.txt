We saw with water that the orientation of atoms around the oxygen was tetrahydral
					with the angle between the two hydrogen atoms close what would be expected for a
					tetrahydral shape. Both carbon and nitrogen also form tetrahydral shapes. In the
					case of methane the four hydrogen atoms are at the corners of a tetrahydron. In
					ammonia, the three attached hydrogens form the base of a tetrahydron. In the
					ammonium ion, the addition of a fourth hydrogen, to form
					NH4+, places the fourth hydrogen at the last unoccupied
					corner of the tetrahydron.
