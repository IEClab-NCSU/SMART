You might wonder how the DNA polymerase, as a protein, can resist such a high
                    temperature. In fact, the DNA polymerases used for PCR are derived from
                    organisms that can live at extremely high temperatures. The most common DNA
                    polymerase used for PCR is called Taq, and it is found in the microbe Thermus aquaticus, which was first discovered in the
                    Lower Geyser Basin at Yellowstone National Park.
