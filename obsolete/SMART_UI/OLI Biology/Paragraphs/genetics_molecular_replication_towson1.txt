Before a cell can divide, it must first make a copy or replica of
            its DNA through a process called DNA replication. This process occurs
            during the S phase of the cell
                cycle, so by the time the cell enters the mitotic
                phase, there are two copies of the DNA molecule. This process of
                DNA replication takes place in the nucleus of the cell in eukaryotes,
            where the DNA molecule is found. It also occurs in the mitochondria in animal cells and
                chloroplasts in plant cells.
