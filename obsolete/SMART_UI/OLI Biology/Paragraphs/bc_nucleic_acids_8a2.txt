During translation, the information in the mRNA is used to determine the order in which
            to string together amino acids and build a particular protein. The sequence of bases in
            the mRNA determines which amino acid will be used in the protein. Every three bases
            codes for a single amino acid. These three bases are called codons or triplets. For
            example, the mRNA codon UGG codes for the amino acid tryptophan.
