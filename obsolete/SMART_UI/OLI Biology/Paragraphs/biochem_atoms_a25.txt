The number of protons, neutrons, and electrons are characteristics of an atom.
					Differences in the number of these subatomic particles are what distinguish one
					type of atom from another. Furthermore, each of these subatomic particles has an
					electrical charge that influences how one atom will interact with another.
					Notice in the diagram of an atom above that the protons have a plus
					sign (+) indicating their positive electrical charge. Electrons
					have a negative charge designated by the negative sign (-).
						Neutrons are electrically neutral, neither positive nor
					negatively charged.
