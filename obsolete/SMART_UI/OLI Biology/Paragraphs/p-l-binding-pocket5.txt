 In general the affinity of the ligand will increase proportionately as the number of
			specific interactions between the ligand and the protein increase. In the example of the
			binding pocket of the estrogen receptor there are several hydrogen bond contacts and a
			hydrophobic pocket for the mostly hydrophobic estrogen. Other protein ligand binding
			interactions are based on fewer contacts, as in the case of oxygen binding to myoglobin
			and thus the affinity is lower.
