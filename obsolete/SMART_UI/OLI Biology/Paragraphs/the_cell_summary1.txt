In this unit, we learned about the cell, which is the fundamental unit of all living
			systems. Cells can be divided into two major groups: prokaryotes
			(cells without a nucleus) and eukaryotes
			(cells containing a nucleus). Eukaryotic cells are larger and contain organelles that
			are specifically related to different cellular functions.
