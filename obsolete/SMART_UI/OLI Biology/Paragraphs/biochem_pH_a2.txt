Hydrogen ion
							concentration can vary over many orders of magnitude. To represent very
							large differences in concentration levels a logarithmic mathematical
							function is used to denote the pH scale. The pH scale is the -log of the
							hydrogen ion concentration:  pH =
								-log[H+]. The log conversion reduces a 10 fold
							change in hydrogen ion concentration to a one unit change in pH. The
							minus sign changes the negative numbers that would be obtained from
							log[H+] to positive ones. Thus, starting at pH 7, a solution at pH 6
							would have 10 times more H+ than a neutral solution. On the
							other hand, a solution at pH 8 would have 10 times fewer H+
							than the solution with pH 7. If you skip a few units, the differences
							between solutions become very great indeed.
							Lemon juice (pH 2) has 1 million times more H+ ions per unit
							volume than seawater, which has a pH of about 8.
