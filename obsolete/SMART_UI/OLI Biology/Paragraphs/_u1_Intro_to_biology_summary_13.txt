Biology takes place over a huge range of scales in space and time. A complete
			understanding of biology requires an interdisciplinary approach. In particular, concepts
			from chemistry and physics are required to explain biological systems at many levels.
			Each level takes on unique emergent properties that arise from complex interactions at
			lower levels. Life itself is an emergent property: when atoms and molecules are
			organized in a particular way, a living (biotic) cell is generated that is capable of
			growth and reproduction. The properties of tissues and organs emerge from interactions
			among cells; tissues and organs combine to form an organism; and multiple organisms give
			rise to populations, communities, and complex ecosystems.
