The winding function of histones plays a very important role in cells. It
			allows the DNA to be condensed into organized bundles (chromosomes) that
			can easily be moved around the cell. Because the DNA is wound around the histones in
			such an organized way, the DNA can be easily wound up and unwound at various points
			during the cell cycle. For example, chromosomes must unwind slightly when a new copy of
			DNA is made. In order for a new copy of the DNA to be made, the replication enzymes must
			be able to access the DNA. It is nearly impossible for these enzymes to get to the DNA if the DNA
			is tightly bound by histone proteins. Therefore, the chromosomes are unwound prior to
			DNA replication. Following DNA replication (synthesis), the
			chromosomes become very tightly wound as the cell gets ready to divide during mitosis or
			meiosis. Without an organized compaction system, the long pieces of DNA in chromosomes
			could easily become "knotted" and tangled. Think of a long piece of string. Knots can
			easily form in the string if it is not carefully wound up into a ball. Keeping the DNA
			organized is critical, especially when you consider that the DNA in one human cell is
			three feet long when it is stretched out straight. This is quite amazing when you
			realize that this must fit into a cell so small that it cannot be seen with the naked
			eye. This feat is achieved by two different winding processes. One of these is the
			winding of DNA around histone molecules. As a result of this winding, the DNA molecule
			becomes shorter than before it was wound around the histone molecules.
