Macroevolution is the longer-term outcome of microevolution. It occurs at the levels of
            species and higher-level groups (lineages). Speciation is the splitting apart of a
            lineage into two or more new species. It can occur through isolation in space
            (allopatric) or through behavioral or genetic mechanisms within a continuous habitat
            (sympatric). After splitting, lineages evolve independently of each other. Over time,
            changes accumulate and additional splits generate clusters of related species (clades).
            Members of a clade share homologous features: inherited characteristics that can be
            traced to an ancestor that they share.
