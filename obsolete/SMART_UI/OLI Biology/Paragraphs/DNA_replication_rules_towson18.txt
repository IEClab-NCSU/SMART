Characterization of large numbers of microorganisms, rapid screening for genetic diseases
          and identification of individuals or species from very small amounts of tissues or cells
          requires a means to amplify a specific sequence of DNA for further manipulation.
          Previously this would have required growing large quantities of cells containing the DNA
          or obtaining large quantities of the tissue. DNA replication is the process of doubling
          the original amount of DNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is simply a method by
          which DNA replication is repeated through many cycles. In the same way that doubling a
          bacterial cell through 20 cycles will generate a million copies of the bacteria,
          replication of DNA through 20 cycles will amplify the amount of DNA by a million fold.
