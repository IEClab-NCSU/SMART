In the figure above, Mark’s genes have been passed down to a second generation
					because his children have mated and have children of their own. Mark is
					successful evolutionarily speaking and his alleles have become more common
					through his reproduction and that of his offspring. The evolutionary success of
					Matt’s genes is zero because he has no offspring. Sexual selection is a powerful
					driving force within evolution.
