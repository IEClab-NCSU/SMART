You may have another question about the skeletal diagrams: what happened to the hydrogen
					atoms attached to the carbon atoms? It looks like some of the carbons only have
					two or three covalent bonds! 
					The skeletal diagrams are often drawn to be simple,
					not to show every atom. It is understood that carbon must have four bonds, and
					in any carbon-based molecule there are often one, two, or even three hydrogen
					atoms bonded to each carbon. To clean up the diagram, the H atoms are not drawn.
					It is assumed you will understand that any “missing” bond is actually provided
					by a hydrogen atom.
