If an acid gives a hydrogen ion (H+) in solution and a base accepts a hydrogen ion
			by giving a hydroxide ion (OH-), you may be wondering what will happen when
			an acid and a base are combined. Letâ€™s consider the combination of equal amounts of
			hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base. When
			the hydrogen ion (H+) is released from hydrochloric acid, and the hydroxide
			ion (OH-) is released from sodium hydroxide, the two ions combine to form
			water (HOH). Water, as you know, has a neutral pH, so the process of combining an acid
			and a base is called neutralization. Remember, in a neutral solution (like water) the
			number of hydrogen ions equals the number of hydroxide ions. The remaining sodium ion
				(Na+) from the sodium hydroxide and the remaining chloride ion
				(Cl-) from the hydrochloric acid also stay in solution as dissolved table
			salt (NaCl). This process can be written as it is below:
