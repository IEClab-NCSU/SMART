As an example of how the components of an organ system work together, let’s look at
                the skeletal system. The most obvious components of this system are the bones, which
                form a rigid framework for the body. The bones contribute to our ability to stand
                upright and move around, but they can’t do it alone. 
Ligaments

 and 
cartilage

 are also parts of the skeletal system. Ligaments connect the bones to each
                other. Cartilage cushions the spaces between the bones, allowing for smooth
                movement. And the bones couldn’t move at all without the skeletal muscles, and 
tendons

 that connect muscles to bones (parts of the muscular system). The bones
                provide the muscles with something to pull against.
