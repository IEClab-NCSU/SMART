The process of DNA transcription is described as DNA-directed RNA synthesis. This
      process, which takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, has many similarities with DNA
      replication. The enzyme to catalyze the process is RNA Polymerase that likewise has
      some characteristics similar to those of DNA polymerase used in replication but it also has
      significant differences.
