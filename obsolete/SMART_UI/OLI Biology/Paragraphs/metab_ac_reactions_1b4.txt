Technically, metabolic pathways are
					ordered sets of chemical reactions that occur within a cell to modify an initial
					molecule to form another product; enzymes catalyze (or
					increase) the rate of reaction. Metabolic pathways are catabolic
					(break-down molecules) or anabolic (synthesize or combine
					molecules) and result in molecular products which can be used by the cell
					immediately, used to initiate another chemical reaction, or stored in the cell.
					You will explore catabolism and anabolism further in the next sections.
