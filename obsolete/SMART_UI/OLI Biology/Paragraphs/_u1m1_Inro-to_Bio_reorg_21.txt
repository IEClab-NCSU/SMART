All matter can be classified into one of two categories: biotic (living) or
					abiotic (non-living). Something is considered biotic if it was ever alive at
					some point in time. In this sense, a dead human buried underground in a wooden
					coffin is still biotic, as is the wood used to make the coffin (the wood came
					from a tree that was once alive). However, not everything within or made by a
					living organism is biotic. For example, urea, a chemical component of urine, is
					abiotic.
