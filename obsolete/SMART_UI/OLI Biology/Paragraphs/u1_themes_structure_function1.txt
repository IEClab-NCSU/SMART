Biologists describe how organisms are put together (structure) and
				explain how organisms stay alive, move, grow, reproduce, and do other activities
				(function). The two are intimately related. “Structure” is defined in part as the
				composition of a feature: what it is made of. Different materials have properties -
				such as strength, flexibility, and many more - that influence how they are used in
				cells and bodies. Second, structure also involves shape: the three-dimensional form
				of a feature. Consider a piece of wood. Depending on how it is shaped, it could be
				used as a spear, drinking cup, smoking pipe, or even a musical flute. In biology,
				thousands of materials make up our cells and bodies and they can be shaped in
				countless ways to generate the rich functions of life.
