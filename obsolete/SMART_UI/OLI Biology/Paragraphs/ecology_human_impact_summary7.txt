There are many potential actions humans can take to reduce risks from
                    accelerating problems like climate change and biodiversity loss. In the case of
                    climate change, we are beginning to respond with two overall strategies. The
                    first, mitigation, seeks to slow climate change by reducing the rate of increase
                    in greenhouse gas levels. The second, adaptation, is an effort to prepare for
                    future changes in climate and minimize harm to humans and ecosystems. Both
                    approaches will require concerted effort on a global scale.
