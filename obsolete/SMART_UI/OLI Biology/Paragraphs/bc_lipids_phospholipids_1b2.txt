With their “split personality,” phospholipids are able to play a very important role in
			biology. Phospholipids, together with other molecules in smaller quantities, form
			membranes that surround the cell and intracellular organelles such as mitochondria. The
			cell membrane is a fluid, semipermeable bilayer that separates the cell's contents from
			the environment. See animation below.
