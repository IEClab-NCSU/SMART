Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of populations or larger groups of
                organisms over generations of time.
Natural selection is a key process of evolution and explains lifeâ€™s adaptive
                features.
Life on Earth is ancient (at least 3.6 billion years old) and all life forms are
                related by ancestry from one or a few single-celled common ancestors.
