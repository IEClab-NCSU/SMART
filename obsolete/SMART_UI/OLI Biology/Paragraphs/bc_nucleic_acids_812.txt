Each tRNA carries a particular amino acid and has a special recognition site comprised of
			three bases that can bind to a specific sequence of bases on mRNA. Base pairing between
			three bases on tRNA and three bases on mRNA ensures that the correct amino acid is added
			to the growing protein chain. During translation, ribosome slides along the mRNA and
			catalyzes formation of peptide bonds between amino acids positioned by the tRNAs.
