The current level is almost twice as high as the long term average over the
                        past several hundred thousand years. These data come from analysis of
                        bubbles of air trapped in ice. Glacial ice has annual layers and can be
                        dated, allowing researchers to look back in time as they drill deeper into
                        the ice. The longest records now come from ice cores extending over 3 km
                        deep into an Antarctic glacier. Throughout the 800,000-year period of
                        record, CO2 levels never exceeded 300 ppm and were typically
                        around 220 ppm.
