Pigments are colored substances that absorb light energy. Different
                                colored pigments absorb different wavelengths of light. The color of
                                the pigment that we see is the wavelength that the pigment reflects
                                (and does not absorb). The light energy absorbed by these pigments
                                can be converted to chemical energy in the process of
                                photosynthesis.
