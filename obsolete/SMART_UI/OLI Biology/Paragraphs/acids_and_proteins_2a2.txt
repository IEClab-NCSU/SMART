Two amino acids join to form a dipeptide. Longer chains of connected amino acids are
			often called polypeptides. When polypeptides are synthesized, new amino acids are added
			only to the carboxylic acid end of the existing chain. A completed polypeptide is
			directional; it has two different ends. One end has a free amino group, while the other
			end has a free carboxylic acid group. When amino acids in a protein are counted, the
			numbering starts with the amino acid that has the free amino group. The last amino acid
			is also the last one that was added when the chain was built: it has a free carboxylic
			acid group.
