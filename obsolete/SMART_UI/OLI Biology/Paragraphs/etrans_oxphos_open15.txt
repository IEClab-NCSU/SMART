Typical proton concentration differences across the inner membrane are approximately 10
          fold, with the outside being more acidic. In addition to the concentration difference,
          there is also an approximately 100 mV voltage difference across the membrane, with the
          inside being more negative. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change under these conditions
          at 300 K is:
