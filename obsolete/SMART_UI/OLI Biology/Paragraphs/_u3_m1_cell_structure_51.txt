As you recall from learning about the cell theory, every cell in your body comes from the division of a
			previously existing cell. How do cells "know" when to divide? What factors control this
			process? These are vitally important questions with implications for how we grow, heal,
			and reproduce. They are also central to understanding cancer - and for developing cancer
			treatments.
