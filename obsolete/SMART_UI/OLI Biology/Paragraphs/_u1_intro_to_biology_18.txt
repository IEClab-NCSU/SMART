In order for cells to function they require energy and matter. Cells take in
					nutrients, use energy, grow, and rid themselves of waste in a process called
					metabolism. You will study metabolism in the fourth unit of this course.
					Metabolism will draw upon your understanding of chemistry: cells use chemical
					nutrients and chemical energy sources. You will also need to use your
					understanding of cells: there are certain parts of the cell whose role is to
					break down nutrients, build new material, and manage the energy needs of the
					cell. Every living organism undergoes metabolism, so it is a crucial concept in
					biology. This figure demonstrates one metabolic pathway: a series of chemical
					reactions that starts the process of breaking down sugar for use as fuel in a
					cell.
