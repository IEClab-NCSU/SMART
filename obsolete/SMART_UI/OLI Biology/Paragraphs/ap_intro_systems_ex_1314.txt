The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and
                            parasympathetic divisions. The sympathetic nervous system
                            controls functions that speed up the heart and increase energy usage
                            during emergencies or times of stress. On the other hand, the
                                parasympathetic nervous system controls functions that
                            have the opposite effectâ€”they reduce heart rate and decrease overall
                            energy usage when the body is returning to normal after an emergency or
                            during normal functioning.
