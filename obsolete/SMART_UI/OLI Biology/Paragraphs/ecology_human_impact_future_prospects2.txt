Based on our graph showing how population has exploded during the Industrial Age,
                    you may assume that it will continue to increase dramatically with no end in
                    sight. Recall that world population began to grow rapidly in the 1800s. At this
                    time death rates began to fall rapidly with advances in public health worldwide.
                    Some of the most important factors were improved sanitation, basic medical care,
                    and nutrition; later the trend was reinforced by immunization and the use of
                    antibiotics. This health-driven reduction in death rates started in western
                    Europe, North America, and other industrialized nations. Today, all nations have
                    benefited to some degree from these trends; total longevity is increasing
                    worldwide and rates of infant and child mortality continue to fall. Death rates
                    are low and headed lower. Does this mean populations are growing equally fast
                    everywhere?
