The genetic code table below shows all possible combinations of three bases and
					the corresponding amino acids that the codons encode. For example, the mRNA
					codon UGG encodes for the amino acid tryptophan. Note that there are 64 codons
					and only 20 common amino acids. Three of the codons do not specify amino acids,
					but instead signal the end of translation; these are called stop codons. The remaining 61 codons encode for 20 amino acids. Of
					these, the codon for the amino acid methionine, AUG, has a dual role. It is used
					to signal the start of most protein-coding regions in the mRNA; thus, it is the
						start codon. The same codon is used if methionine
					occurs at an internal position in the protein sequence.
