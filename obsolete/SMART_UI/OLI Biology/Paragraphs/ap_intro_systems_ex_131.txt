The basic functional units of the nervous system that transmit messages are cells
                    called neurons. Signals travel through a neuron as electrical
                    impulses. Neurons release chemical substances, known as
                        neurotransmitters, to transmit information to other neurons, to
                    muscles, or to glands. The chemical messages of the nervous system are
                    transmitted over short distances, and their effects are short-lived. The nervous
                    system allows for control and coordination of skeletal muscular movements that
                    may be consciously predetermined, or may happen automatically, such as reflexes.
                    Other parts of the nervous system control and coordinate subconscious body
                    activities, including heart rate, gland secretions and smooth muscle movement in
                    the digestive system. Some activities, such as breathing, can be controlled both
                    subconsciously and consciously. The nervous system typically works quickly. It
                    also allows us to integrate and store information, such as when you are
                    learning.
