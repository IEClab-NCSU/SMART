Temperature and pH represent environmental means of regulating the velocity of an
					enzyme catalyzed reaction. However, in a typical organism (in vivo) the
					temperature and pH are usually regulated and therefore cannot be used to control
					enzyme activity. Consequently, the velocity of enzymatic reactions are usually
					regulated by molecular interaction of a second molecule with the enzyme. These
					are generally termed inhibitors if the binding of the second molecules causes a
					loss of enzyme activity (reduced velocity at any given substrate concentration).
