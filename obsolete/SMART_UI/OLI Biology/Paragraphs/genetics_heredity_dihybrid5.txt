As you remember from the Meiosis module, during meiosis I, after crossing-over, the
                    chromosome pairs separate randomly. This means that Y and y will separate, as
                    will R and r. But which goes to which gamete is random. So the Y allele in a
                    chromosome can be associated with a chromosome containing the R allele or the r
                    allele, and the R allele can be paired with a chromosome containing the Y allele
                    or the y allele. Therefore, there are four possible gametes in a dihybrid
                    cross.
