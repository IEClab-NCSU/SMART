Plants, algae, and some bacteria can use light energy to turn carbon dioxide and water
			into simple sugars through the process of photosynthesis. These sugars can
			act as “building blocks” for the synthesis of other organic molecules, or they can store
			energy for later use. While the process of photosynthesis stores chemical
				energy for later use, most photosynthetic organisms access the stored energy
			the same way consumers do: they break down the sugars to build ATP using the process of
				cellular respiration, which occurs in subcellular organelles called
				mitochondria.
