Non-competitive inhibition involves a second small molecule binding to the
					enzyme. In this case there are two binding sites: one for the substrate and a
					distinct one for the inhibitor. When the inhibitor binds to the enzyme, the
					substrate binding pocket changes such that the substrate is no longer able to
					bind. It may also be possible for both the substrate and inhibitor to bind the
					enzyme at the same time but the enzyme is unable to complete the conversion of
					substrate to product. Non-competitive inhibition results in a lower maximum
					velocity for the enzyme when the inhibitor is present as can be seen in the
					green curve. Inihibitors of this type are often referred to as
					allosteric inhibitors because they cause the shape (steric) of the
					enzyme to assume a different (allo) form.
