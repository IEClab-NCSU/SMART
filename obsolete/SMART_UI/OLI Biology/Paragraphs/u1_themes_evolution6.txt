Some religious traditions, interpreted literally, conflict
                with evolutionâ€™s account of the past.
Evolution suggests that humans are quite similar to other
                animals and that we are linked to all other life forms by ancestry.
The process of evolution involves genetic changes (mutations)
                that occur at random. This may conflict with a view that life has an order and
                purpose determined by a higher power.
