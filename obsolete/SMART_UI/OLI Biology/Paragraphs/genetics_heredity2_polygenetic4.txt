For instance, in Labrador retrievers, the allele for black fur color
                    (B) is dominant with regard to the allele for brown (“chocolate”) fur color (b).
                    However, there are also yellow Labs. The coats of yellow labs are created
                    through epistasis. Another gene, E/e, is in play.
