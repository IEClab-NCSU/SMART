If a cell is going to reproduce, more DNA is needed. During
				mitosis, one cell divides into two cells containing identical genetic
			material. This requires twice as much DNA, because there must be one complete set for
			each daughter cell. Meiosis also requires the DNA to be replicated. DNA
			replication (or DNA synthesis) occurs in the synthesis (S) stage of the cell
			cycle.
