In the Introduction to Chemistry
			 unit, you learned that atoms are the building blocks of all matter. You also learned
			that atoms can be
			linked together with chemical bonds, to form  molecules that have their own unique
			properties. In this unit, you will take a closer look at a special group of molecules
			that form the backbone of living structures: the biological macromolecules.
			Biological macromolecules are special molecules that contain carbon atoms covalently
				bonded with hydrogen atoms.
