This occurs because acetic acid is the only proton donor in the solution. What would happen if protons are added to the solution from another source, for example a strong acid, or a biochemical reaction that releases protons? Answer the question before continuing. Because the equilibrium constant Ka does not change, the presence of additional protons from another source must shift the ratio of acetate ions to acetic acid, and a new equilibrium point would be reached. For the following acid dissociation: HA A- + H+ with an equilibrium constant of: K a = [ A ] [ H + ] [ HA ] How will the equilibrium position change when the proton concentration changes? If protons are added [A-] must decrease and [HA] increase in order for Ka to remain the same. Likewise if protons are removed by adding a strong base then [A-] must increase, and [HA] decrease to keep Ka constant. The ratio of [A-] to [HA] changes depending on the total [H+] of the solution. To quantify how the equilibrium point is affected by pH, it is instructive to rearrange the equilibrium equation to generate the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation. First we start with the general equilibrium equation for Ka: K = [ A - ] [ H + ] [ HA ] and then take the -log of both sides of the equation. log ( K ) = log ( [ A - ] [ HA ] ) log ( [ H + ] ) You may recognize that -log(Ka) is pKa and the -log([H+]) is pH. By substituting these into the equation we have the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation. pH = pKa log ( [ A - ] [ HA ] ) This equation can be used to calculate the ratio of [A-]/[HA] for any weak acid, provided the pKa of the acid and the pH of the solution are known. Effect of pH on Protonation State The fraction of a group that is protonated: [HA]/{[HA]+[A-]} can be calculated at any pH using the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation. Such a plot is shown below for acetic acid. Note that: When pH = pKa, one half of the molecules will be protonated When the pH is one unit lower than the pKa 90% of the molecules will be protonated. When the pH is one unit higher than the pKa only 10% of the molecules are protonated. For pH values outside +/-1 pH unit from the pKa the group is essentially fully protonated (pH << pKa) or fully deprotonated (pH >> pKa) The fraction protonated as a function of pH is plotted for a weak acid with a pKa=4.0, such as acetic acid. Note that when the ph=pKaone-half of the molecules will be protonated. More than half are protonated with the pH is lower than the pKa while less than half are protonated when the pH is greater than the pKa. Buffers Weak acids can act as pH buffers when the pH is within approximately one unit of the pKa for the acid. A buffer solution will resist changes in pH as a strong acid or base is added to the solution. The following shows the pH of a solution of a weak acid as a strong base, e.g. hydroxide, is added or titrated into the solution. The pH of a solution of a weak acid with a pKa of 4.0 is shown as base is added to the solution. The initial pH of the solution is low, and most of the weak acid is fully protonated. As base is added the weak acid remains protonated, consequently the added base causes a rapid rise in pH due to the neutralization of protons. When the pH of the solution is near the pKa of the weak acid, the acid begins to dissociate, producing protons that neutralize the added base. Since the base is being neutralized the pH climbs more slowly. When the pH is above the pKa most to the weak acid is deprotonated and can no longer provide protons to neutralize the base, consequently the pH climbs rapidly again. The pH region that is within one unit of the pKa is considered to be the buffer region. Understanding the reverse titration, the addition of a strong acid to a solution of conjugate base follows the same logic. At high pH, the added protons do not protonate the weak acid since the pH is much higher than the pKa. In the buffer region of pH = pKa+/-1, the protons that are added to the solution will not decrease the pH, instead they will convert some of the conjugate base, A-, to the acid form, HA. At the lower edge of the buffer region the weak acid is almost fully protonated (pH=pKa-1), consequently it cannot absorb any additional protons. The buffering of pH plays an important role in the normal function of the cell. If the pH drops too low, or becomes too high, the cell can no longer function. The principal buffer that is used in biological systems is the carbonic acid, a weak acid with an effective pKa of 6.4, ideally suited to act as a buffer when the pH ~ 7.0 Graded Quiz Placing acetic acid in pure water establishes an equilibrium between the charged and neutral forms according to the unique dissociation constant of the acid.

Ka is constant for an acid. In the tutorial you learned that the equilibrium constant Ka is the same for an acid regardless of the starting concentration. Ka describes the relationship between the concentration of the protonated acid and the charged dissociated species at equilibrium. You also saw that even though Ka is constant, the values of the concentration of each species was varying over time. After an initial rapid dissociation of the acid, an equilibrium was reached. At equilibrium, the number of individual molecules will fluctuate, but on average, a balance, or equilibrium mixture, is maintained. The balance of products and reactants is defined by Ka. Each acid has its own Ka The equilibrium constant, Ka, is a property of the molecule and its environment. The chemical nature of the molecule has the largest effect on Ka. Secondary to this, the environment of the group can shift the Ka. Therefore, every acidic group has its own Ka value. For the purposes of this course, we will use the approximation that Ka is the same for all molecules with the same functional group. The table below lists the Ka values for several acids. Ka for various acids Acid Ka Acetic Acid 0.0001 Boric Acid 0.000000001 Ammonia (NH4+) 0.000000001 Relationship of Ka and pKa The Ka is a small number, usually much less than 1, and can vary by several orders of magnitude from compound to compound. For example, acetic acid has a Ka of around 0.0001 or 1.0 x 10-4 while the Ka of ammonia is 105 fold smaller. Due to the wide range of Ka, it is more practical to represent the Ka on a minus log scale, in the same way as the hydrogen ion concentration. Consequently, the negative log of the Ka is used to represent acidity constants: pKa = -log(Ka) A change in the pKa from 5 to a pKa 4 is the change by a factor of 10 in the Ka. The table below will help you see the relationship between Ka and pKa. The pKa is a convenient scale for comparing the dissociation constants of weak acids because the pKa scale is similar to the pH scale. The relationship between the two will be explained in the next few pages. Remember that the pKa is a property of the acidic group while pH is a property of the solution. Ka pKa 0.1 1 0.01 2 0.001 3 0.0001 4 0.00001 5 Just as the pH scale indicates the relative proton concentration of various solutions, the pKa indicates the relative strengths of the different acids. If a reaction has a large equilibrium constant, then the concentration of the products will be higher than the reactants. In the case of the acidity constant, a larger Ka indicates a more completely dissociated acid, or a stronger acid. Since the pKa = - log (Ka), strong acids will have small pKa values. For this course you do not need to memorize the pKa values for all of the different groups. The values will always be given to you, or you can find them in the Functional Groups Glossary. However, it is useful to remember the following pKa values: Acidic Group pKa Example -COOH (carboxyl) 4.0 Aspartic acid side chain. -NH3 (amino) 9.0 Lysine side chain In the tutorial you learned that the equilibrium constant Ka is the same for an acid regardless of the starting concentration.

Due to the wide range of Ka, it is more practical to represent the Ka on a minus log scale, in the same way as the hydrogen ion concentration. Consequently, the negative log of the Ka is used to represent acidity constants: pKa = -log(Ka) A change in the pKa from 5 to a pKa 4 is the change by a factor of 10 in the Ka. The table below will help you see the relationship between Ka and pKa. The pKa is a convenient scale for comparing the dissociation constants of weak acids because the pKa scale is similar to the pH scale. The relationship between the two will be explained in the next few pages. Remember that the pKa is a property of the acidic group while pH is a property of the solution. Ka pKa 0.1 1 0.01 2 0.001 3 0.0001 4 0.00001 5 Just as the pH scale indicates the relative proton concentration of various solutions, the pKa indicates the relative strengths of the different acids. If a reaction has a large equilibrium constant, then the concentration of the products will be higher than the reactants. In the case of the acidity constant, a larger Ka indicates a more completely dissociated acid, or a stronger acid. Since the pKa = - log (Ka), strong acids will have small pKa values. For this course you do not need to memorize the pKa values for all of the different groups. The values will always be given to you, or you can find them in the Functional Groups Glossary. However, it is useful to remember the following pKa values: Acidic Group pKa Example -COOH (carboxyl) 4.0 Aspartic acid side chain. -NH3 (amino) 9.0 Lysine side chain In the tutorial you learned that the equilibrium constant Ka is the same for an acid regardless of the starting concentration. Ka describes the relationship between the concentration of the protonated acid and the charged dissociated species at equilibrium. You also saw that even though Ka is constant, the values of the concentration of each species was varying over time. After an initial rapid dissociation of the acid, an equilibrium was reached. At equilibrium, the number of individual molecules will fluctuate, but on average, a balance, or equilibrium mixture, is maintained. The balance of products and reactants is defined by Ka. The equilibrium constant, Ka, is a property of the molecule and its environment. The chemical nature of the molecule has the largest effect on Ka. Secondary to this, the environment of the group can shift the Ka. Therefore, every acidic group has its own Ka value. For the purposes of this course, we will use the approximation that Ka is the same for all molecules with the same functional group. The table below lists the Ka values for several acids.

This is similar to calculating the pKa. log(K)=log([A-][H+][HA]) Using the rules of logs we can separate the right side of the equation into two terms. log(K)=log([A-][HA])+log([H-]) Next we multiply everything by -1. Remember these numbers are usually much smaller than one and log of these terms would be negative. By multiplying by -1 we make the numbers positive. log(K)=log([A-][HA])log([H-]) Now two terms should be familiar: pKa = -log(K) and pH = -log([H+]). So we substitute those in. pKa=log([A-][HA])+pH Finally we re-arrange to arrive at the familiar form of the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation. pH=pKalog([A-][HA])   pH and Buffers Be able to determine the charge on functional groups, given a pH. Be able to define a buffer and its utility to the biological system. pH pH is the measure of the concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution. pH stands for -log[H+], where [H+] is read hydrogen ion concentration. Water molecules exist in an equilibrium between a complete water molecule and the dissociated proton H+ and conjugate base OH-. H2O <=> H+ + OH- At low pH, the concentrations of protons is high and the solution is acidic, and, at high pH, the concentrations of protons is low and the solution is basic, due to an abundance of hydronium ions, OH -. For our reference we will define an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. pH of various compounds.On the left are biological compounds and on the right are some foods and cleaning products. Differences in hydrogen concentration Weak Electrolytes Hydrochloric Acid, like sodium chloride, is a strong electrolyte that completely dissociates in aqueous solution into charged ions. It is also a strong acid because when it completely dissociates, it is also completely donating all of its protons. Some molecules are weak electrolytes and exist in equilibrium between the starting molecule and its dissociated parts. For molecules that are weak electrolytes and act as acids, the ratio of the dissociated parts and the parent molecule is a constant in neutral water for each separate structure. The dissociation can be seen as an acid dissociating into a proton and the conjugate base: In general: HA (acid) <=> A- (conjugate base) + H+ (proton) Specifically for Acetic acid: CH3COOH <=> CH3COO- (conjugate base) + H+ (proton) The ratio of dissociated parts to parent acid is expressed as: [1] K = [CH3COO-]*[H+]/[ CH3COOH] K is the equilibrium constant (in this case also a dissociation constant) and is the ratio of charged species to the neutral species. Looking at both the chemical equilibrium given above and the equation for the equilibrium constant (K), the concentration of the acid and conjugate base will be influenced by the concentration of protons (the pH of the environment in which the reaction is placed). Using some simple mathematical substitutions, the equilibrium constant equation becomes the Hendersson-Hasselbach equation that describes the relationship between the amount of dissociation and the pH of the solution: [2] log K = log ([CH3COO-]/[ CH3COOH]) + log[H+] Rearranging we get: [3] -log[H+] = log ([Ch3COO-]/[ CH3COOH]) - log K Substituting pH for -log[H+] and pKa for - log K we get, [4] pH = log[CH3COO-]/CH3COOH] + pKa (Hendersson-Hasselbach equation) When the amount of the charged species is equal to the neutral species then the log[CH3COO-/CH3COOH] is equal to 0 and thus the pH = pKa. The ultimate net charge on the functional group (the carboxyl group in this case) is dependent upon whether the pH is above below or equal to the pKa. When half of the molecules are charged (the pH equals the pKa) the net charge of molecule is 0.5 (in this case –0.5 since a carboxyl can either be zero charge or –1). When the pH is much lower than the pKa (one pH unit below) the net charge is actually –0.1. For practical estimation purposes, we will use the general rule that if the pH is one pH unit below the pKa then the functional group will be fully protonated and thus in this case the net charge will be rounded to 0. At one pH unit above the molecule the functional group, in this case the carboxyl group, would have an actual net charge of –0.9 because the proton will be lost from the carboxyl group. Again for estimation purposes, we will round all values one pH above the pKa of a carboxyl to –1. Relationship of pH, ratio, and charge. Acetic acid, pKa ~= 4 pHRatioActual Net ChargeEstimated Net Charge 30.1-0.10 41-0.5-0.5 510-0.9-1 The ratio of all weak acids is 1 when pH = pKa. Thus the above table would look similar for all weak acids with the difference being the pH would change in relation to the pKa for the acid. Weak Electrolytes as Buffers Weak electrolytes buffer solutions against large changes in pH over a range of pKa + 1 pH unit or pKa - 1 pH unit. They do this by shifting the equilibrium of the charged to uncharged ratio. The pKa of a molecule is experimentally determined by titration. Strong base is added in small increments to a solution of a weak acid and the change in pH is recorded. In the tutorial you will explore how the pH changes and the relationship of pKa to pH. You will also explore the equilibrium established by a weak base. pH is the measure of the concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution. pH stands for -log[H+], where [H+] is read hydrogen ion concentration.

Electrolytes and pH Upon completing this module, students will be able to: Describe the relationship between pH and proton concentration. Distinguish acids from bases, and explain their relationship to acid dissociation. pH The hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] of a solution is an important property because biological systems contains functional groups whose properties are changed by changes in the hydrogen ion concentration. Since the hydrogen ion concentations are usually much less than one, and can vary over many orders of magnitude, a different scale is used for the hydrogen ion concentration, the pH scale. The pH is the -log of the proton concentration: pH = - log [H+]. The log conversion reduces a 10 fold change in hydrogen ion concentration to a one unit change in pH. The minus sign changes the negative numbers that would be obtained from log[H+] to positive ones. Since the pH scale is an inverse scale the concentration of protons is high at low pH and low at high pH. A solution is said to be acidic if the pH is less than seven, and basic if the pH is above 7. A solution is neutral if its pH is equal to 7.0. The image below shows the pH of a number of common fluids. pH of various compounds.

Hydrochloric acid is also a strong acid because when it completely dissociates it also completely donates all of its protons.

Describe the dynamics of equilibrium. Explain the relationship between the concentration of acid and conjugate base at equilibrium. Acid Dissociation and Equilibrium In this, and following, sections, we will begin to develop a quantitative relationship between the strength of an acid and how the acids ionization state will depend on the pH of the solution. When placed in water, acetic acid dissociates into the conjugate base, acetate, and a proton. CH3COOH CH3COO- + H+ The extent to which the acid will dissociate in pure water is expressed as Ka, the equilibrium constant for dissociation of an acid: K a = [ C H 3 COO ] [ H ] [ C H 3 COOH ] Ka is the ratio of the mathematical product of the concentration of each product of the reaction (in this case the charged species) to the concentration of the reactants (in this case the neutral species). The square brackets [ ] around the terms indicate concentration and is usually expressed in molar concentration (moles/Liter).

In response to threats and opportunities, they may move or change their activities. For example, plant stems can grow toward a source of light. Over time, the trunks of trees strengthen when they are flexed by the wind. Animals, of course, respond to stimuli with a huge range of behaviors from the hibernation of bears to your own development of “goosebumps” on a chilly day. In contrast to the chaos of the outside world, the interior of a cell is a remarkably constant environment. For example, cells typically keep their internal pH (acidity) within a narrow range. Why is this so important? Recall that enzymes will lose their function and many of the chemical reactions of life will not work if cell conditions change too much. If the cell’s surroundings change quickly, conditions inside the cell may be temporarily disturbed. Organisms react to these changes in a corrective fashion: they detect changes and do something to oppose them. When you catch a chill, your muscles may contract in rapid bursts (shivering), generating heat that warms you back up again. The ability or tendency of organisms and cells to maintain stable internal conditions is called homeostasis and is an important theme in biology. The term homeostasis comes from the Greek words homeo (same, alike) and stasis ( standing). It describes how life stands in one place despite many changes in the surrounding world. Your task is to build a body. Not a big body, like a human’s. Just a wee little body, of a creature we’ll call Structo. Of course Structo needs a body - otherwise, how will it function? Structo is just a blob floating in the ocean, and it’s not functioning too well at the moment. Structo needs a part that will allow it to exchange gases between its blood and the surrounding water. It cannot breathe through simple diffusion of gases across the surface of its body -- like a jellyfish or sponge is able to do. Instead, it needs a specialized structure to get rid of a waste gas (carbon dioxide) and take in oxygen gas. Thanks for helping Structo... function. Oops, now Structo has a delicate exposed gill hanging outside its body armor. Maybe it needs an internal chamber so water can flow across the gill in a protected place... You can probably imagine other ways to use the shapes and materials at hand, building a body that will help Structo overcome many different challenges. Environmental pressures have led (and continue to lead) to the evolution of organisms with a virtually infinite range of such combinations. In fact, one of the hottest areas of engineering right now is biomimicry: looking at natural solutions to problems and using similar approaches to build better technology. One of the earliest uses of this approach was the invention of Velcro (hook and loop attachment) by Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral. He was inspired by the burrs that got stuck in his dog’s fur! To learn more: Biomimicry   Homeostasis Living organisms detect and respond to changes in the conditions of their external environment. In response to threats and opportunities, organisms may move or change their activities. For example, plant stems can grow toward a source of light. Over time, the trunks of trees strengthen when they are flexed by the wind. Animals, of course, respond to stimuli with a huge range of behaviors from the hibernation of bears to your own development of “goosebumps” on a chilly day. In contrast to the extreme variability of the outside world, the interior of a cell is a remarkably constant environment. For example, cells typically keep their internal pH (acidity) within a narrow range. This is important because changes in pH can cause molecules like enzymes to change their shapes. As you already know, a molecule’s shape (or structure) determines its function. If its shape changes, it may lose function. Because of this, many of the chemical reactions of life will not work properly if cell conditions change too much. The ability or tendency of organisms and cells to maintain stable internal conditions is called homeostasis. The term homeostasis comes from the Greek words homeo (same, alike) and stasis (standing). It describes how life stands in one place despite many changes in the surrounding world. Environmental conditions can also affect cellular homeostasis. If the cell’s surroundings change quickly, conditions inside the cell may be temporarily disturbed. Organisms react to these changes in a corrective way: they detect changes and do something to oppose them. For example, when you get cold, your muscles start to contract in rapid bursts, causing you to shiver. The process of shivering then generates heat that warms you back up again. As a result of this and other adjustments, your temperature is maintained close to 99 degrees F (Fahrenheit) [37 degrees C (Celsius)]. At this temperature, your enzymes work very efficiently. Homeostasis is an important theme in biology. All living systems use resources to maintain homeostasis. When cells fail to maintain homeostasis, disease results. Ultimately, if homeostasis is not restored, an organism will die.   Introduction to Scientific Inquiry Science is a powerful tool used to understand the natural world. It is the process that has resulted in the knowledge we are exploring in this course. However, the process of science does have limitations. In other words, there are some questions that science cannot be used to answer. For example, science cannot answer questions about supernatural things. It also cannot be used to make moral or aesthetic judgments. While questions of these types may be important for humans to explore, the process of science cannot be used to study them. In this module, the process of science will be discussed in more detail. Then you will learn about how to design a quality scientific experiment. Finally, you will have the opportunity to practice identifying examples of science and to compare those to examples of pseudoscience, or things that claim to be scientific, but are not.   Scientific Inquiry: A Method of Knowing Science deals with testable knowledge about physical phenomena in the universe. The goal of science is to understand how the universe works. Biology focuses on understanding living things. To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called “scientific inquiry.” Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders. Some of these prescientific remedies worked, but the process for discovering new treatments was a slow and haphazard system of trial and error. Ineffective treatments were often accepted simply because there was no clear procedure for evaluating them. Today, with science-based medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900. Scientific inquiry has not displaced faith, intuition, and dreams. These traditions and ways of knowing have emotional value and provide moral guidance to many people. But hunches, feelings, deep convictions, old traditions, or dreams cannot be accepted directly as scientifically valid. Instead, science limits itself to ideas that can be tested through verifiable observations. Supernatural claims that events are caused by ghosts, devils, God, or other spiritual entities cannot be tested in this way. Scientific Methods The rest of this module will focus on the methods of scientific inquiry. Science often involves making observations and developing hypotheses. Experiments and/or further observations are often used to test the hypotheses, and the data gathered are carefully interpreted. Methods and results are then communicated to other scientists within peer-reviewed scientific journals. A scientific experiment is a carefully organized procedure in which the scientist intervenes in a system to change something, then observes the result of the change. Scientific inquiry often involves doing experiments, though not always. For example, a scientist studying the mating behaviors of ladybugs might begin with detailed observations of ladybugs mating in their natural habitats. While this research may not be experimental, it is scientific: it involves careful and verifiable observation of the natural world. The same scientist might then treat some of the ladybugs with a hormone hypothesized to trigger mating and observe whether these ladybugs mated sooner or more often than untreated ones. This would qualify as an experiment because the scientist is now making a change in the system and observing the effects. Science deals with testable knowledge about physical phenomena in the universe. The goal of science is to understand how the universe works. Biology focuses on understanding living things. To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called “scientific inquiry.” Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders. Some of these prescientific remedies worked, but the process for discovering new treatments was a slow and haphazard system of trial and error. Ineffective treatments were often accepted simply because there was no clear procedure for evaluating them. Today, with science-based medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900. Scientific inquiry has not displaced faith, intuition, and dreams. These traditions and ways of knowing have emotional value and provide moral guidance to many people. But hunches, feelings, deep convictions, old traditions, or dreams cannot be accepted directly as scientifically valid. Instead, science limits itself to ideas that can be tested through verifiable observations. Supernatural claims that events are caused by ghosts, devils, God, or other spiritual entities cannot be tested in this way. The rest of this module will focus on the methods of scientific inquiry. Science often involves making observations and developing hypotheses. Experiments and/or further observations are often used to test the hypotheses, and the data gathered are carefully interpreted. Methods and results are then communicated to other scientists within peer-reviewed scientific journals. A scientific experiment is a carefully organized procedure in which the scientist intervenes in a system to change something, then observes the result of the change. Scientific inquiry often involves doing experiments, though not always. For example, a scientist studying the mating behaviors of ladybugs might begin with detailed observations of ladybugs mating in their natural habitats. While this research may not be experimental, it is scientific: it involves careful and verifiable observation of the natural world. The same scientist might then treat some of the ladybugs with a hormone hypothesized to trigger mating and observe whether these ladybugs mated sooner or more often than untreated ones. This would qualify as an experiment because the scientist is now making a change in the system and observing the effects.   Forming a Hypothesis When conducting scientific experiments, researchers develop hypotheses to guide experimental design. A hypothesis offers a testable and falsifiable explanation of observations. For example, a scientist might observe that maple trees lose their leaves in the fall. She might then propose a possible explanation for this observation: “cold weather causes maple trees to lose their leaves in the fall.” This statement is testable. The scientist could grow maple trees in a warm enclosed environment such as a greenhouse and see if their leaves still dropped in the fall. The hypothesis is also falsifiable. If the leaves still dropped in the warm environment, then clearly temperature was not the main factor in causing maple leaves to drop in autumn. In the activity below, you can practice recognizing scientific hypotheses. As you consider each statement, try to think as a scientist would: can I test this hypothesis with observations or experiments? Is the statement falsifiable? In other words, is it possible to gather evidence that clearly indicates that the statement is not true? If the answer is “no,” the statement is not a valid scientific hypothesis. Determine whether the following statement is a scientific hypothesis. Testing a vaccine Throughout the rest of this module, we examine the scientific process by discussing an actual scientific experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Washington to investigate whether a vaccine may reduce the incidence of the Human Papillomavirus Virus (HPV). The experimental process and results were published in an article titled, "A controlled trial of a human papillomavirus type 16 vaccine" [1] , available for viewing online at the National Institutes of Health's online database of publications: PubMed.gov Preliminary observations made by the researchers who conducted the HPV experiment are listed below: Human Papillomavirus Virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. There are about 40 different types of the HPV virus. A significant number of people that have HPV are unaware of it because many of these viruses cause no symptoms. Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer. About 4,000 women a year die of cervical cancer in the United States. HPV Vaccine Experiment Hypothesis: Researchers have developed a potential vaccine against HPV and want to test it. Experiment: The scientists will test this hypothesis by separating 2392 young women into 2 groups: the control group and the experimental group. The control group(s) receives no special treatment, or the treatment that is currently most common. The results from this group give the scientist a base-line reading of what normally occurs. The experimental group(s) is the group that will receive the new treatment. The results of this group will be compared to the results of the control group so that a judgment can be made. The experimental group receives the vaccine, but how can we know if the vaccine made a difference? For this, we need an otherwise similar control group that does not get the treatment. We can then compare the 2 groups and determine if the vaccine made a difference. However, the control group cannot get “nothing.” Scientific studies have shown that the “placebo effect” can alter experimental results. When individuals are told that they are or are not being treated, this knowledge often alters their actions or their emotions - which can alter the results of the experiment. Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also bias the results of the experiment. Subconscious non-verbal cues can alter the patient’s experience and therefore the results of the experiment. Therefore, many clinical studies are “double blind” where neither the doctor nor the patient knows which group the patient is in until all experimental results have been collected. When conducting scientific experiments, researchers develop hypotheses to guide experimental design. A hypothesis offers a testable and falsifiable explanation of observations.

About 4,000 women a year die of cervical cancer in the United States. HPV Vaccine Experiment Researchers have developed a potential vaccine against HPV and want to test it.   Experimental Design You’ve successfully identified a hypothesis for the University of Washington’s study on HPV: People who get the HPV vaccine will not get HPV. The next step is to design an experiment that will test this hypothesis. There are several important factors to consider when designing a scientific experiment. First, scientific experiments must have an experimental group. This is the group that receives the experimental treatment necessary to address the hypothesis. The experimental group receives the vaccine, but how can we know if the vaccine made a difference? Many things may change HPV infection rates in a group of people over time. To clearly show that the vaccine was effective in helping the experimental group, we need to include in our study an otherwise similar control group that does not get the treatment. We can then compare the two groups and determine if the vaccine made a difference. The control group shows us what happens in the absence of the factor under study. However, the control group cannot get “nothing.” Instead, the control group often receives a placebo. A placebo is a procedure that has no expected therapeutic effect — such as giving a person a sugar pill or a shot containing only plain saline solution with no drug. Scientific studies have shown that the “placebo effect” can alter experimental results because when individuals are told that they are or are not being treated, this knowledge can alter their actions or their emotions, which can then alter the results of the experiment. Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also influence the results of the experiment. Without saying so directly, the doctor may show — through body language or other subtle cues — his or her views about whether the patient is likely to get well. These errors can then alter the patient’s experience and change the results of the experiment. Therefore, many clinical studies are “double blind.” In these studies, neither the doctor nor the patient knows which group the patient is in until all experimental results have been collected. Both placebo treatments and double-blind procedures are designed to prevent bias. Bias is any systematic error that makes a particular experimental outcome more or less likely. Errors can happen in any experiment: people make mistakes in measurement, instruments fail, computer glitches can alter data. But most such errors are random and don’t favor one outcome over another. Patients’ belief in a treatment can make it more likely to appear to “work.” Placebos and double-blind procedures are used to level the playing field so that both groups of study subjects are treated equally and share similar beliefs about their treatment. The Experiment The scientists who are researching the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine will test their hypothesis by separating 2,392 young women into two groups: the control group and the experimental group. Answer the following questions about these two groups.   Experimental Variables A variable is a characteristic of a subject (in this case, of a person in the study) that can vary over time or among individuals. Sometimes a variable takes the form of a category, such as male or female; often a variable can be measured precisely, such as body height. Ideally, only one variable is different between the control group and the experimental group in a scientific experiment. Otherwise, the researchers will not be able to determine which variable caused any differences seen in the results. For example, imagine that the people in the control group were, on average, much more sexually active than the people in the experimental group. If, at the end of the experiment, the control group had a higher rate of HPV infection, could you confidently determine why? Maybe the experimental subjects were protected by the vaccine, but maybe they were protected by their low level of sexual contact. To avoid this situation, experimenters make sure that their subject groups are as similar as possible in all variables except for the variable that is being tested in the experiment. This variable, or factor, will be deliberately changed in the experimental group. The one variable that is different between the two groups is called the independent variable. An independent variable is known or hypothesized to cause some outcome. Imagine an educational researcher investigating the effectiveness of a new teaching strategy in a classroom. The experimental group receives the new teaching strategy, while the control group receives the traditional strategy. It is the teaching strategy that is the independent variable in this scenario. In an experiment, the independent variable is the variable that the scientist deliberately changes or imposes on the subjects. Dependent variables are known or hypothesized consequences; they are the effects that result from changes or differences in an independent variable. In an experiment, the dependent variables are those that the scientist measures before, during, and particularly at the end of the experiment to see if they have changed as expected. The dependent variable must be stated so that it is clear how it will be observed or measured. Rather than comparing “learning” among students (which is a vague and difficult to measure concept), an educational researcher might choose to compare test scores, which are very specific and easy to measure. In any real-world example, many, many variables MIGHT affect the outcome of an experiment, yet only one or a few independent variables can be tested. Other variables must be kept as similar as possible between the study groups and are called control variables. For our educational research example, if the control group consisted only of people between the ages of 18 and 20 and the experimental group contained people between the ages of 30 and 35, we would not know if it was the teaching strategy or the students' ages that played a larger role in the results. To avoid this problem, a good study will be set up so that each group contains students with a similar age profile. In a well-designed educational research study, student age will be a controlled variable, along with other possibly-important factors like gender, past educational achievement, and pre-existing knowledge of the subject area. Variables   Interpreting Results Gathering Data After the experiment is completed, results are compiled and interpreted. This involves the measurement of the dependent variable. In the case of our HPV experiment, remember, the dependent variable is the rate of HPV infection. Significance Although the HPV study suggests that the vaccine protects against infection by HPV, is the finding significant? In science, as in life, things can happen for many different reasons. A convincing study will rule out “luck” (random chance) as an explanation for the results. Strong results are said to be significant: very unlikely to occur by chance or random events. Whether the outcome is significant often depends on the size of study; the larger the number of individuals enrolled, the more convincing the results are likely to be. For example, imagine only 10 women were enrolled in the study. In the control group, 2 in 5 of the women became infected. In the experimental group, 0 in 5 were infected. At first you might think this proves the vaccine’s effectiveness, but it is NOT a convincing or significant result. Why not? Random events could easily explain the difference between the groups. For example, perhaps none of the five women in the experimental group were sexually active over the study period. They therefore stood no chance of acquiring HPV. The vaccine might appear to work, but a skeptical reader could account for the results by proposing many other scenarios. However, imagine if the same study were done with 10,000 women, and the infection rates were 2,000 of 5,000 in the control group and zero of 5,000 in the experimental group. Random events would be spread out among a very large group of people in this study; on average, the two big groups should have similar sexual behavior and other factors influencing infection rates. If there is a big difference at the end of the study, it is very unlikely that this result occurred by random chance. Statistical analyses did support the significance of the HPV vaccine result. After the results are interpreted and conclusions are drawn, researchers often return to their work and begin asking further questions. In this way, scientific inquiry is a powerful tool for exploration. After the experiment is completed, results are compiled and interpreted. This involves the measurement of the dependent variable.

Now that you have a pretty good idea about the process of science, you’ll have a chance to identify examples of science and compare those to examples of pseudoscience. Pseudoscience is any claim that purports or pretends to be scientific in nature, but does not actually have the characteristics of true scientific inquiry. Pseudoscientific ideas often involve the supernatural. Sometimes they involve claims about forces or processes that cannot be measured using traditional tools or instruments employed by scientists. Finally, pseudoscientific claims are often quite dramatic. They are “amazing” ideas that would seem strange or unlikely to most scientists working in a related field. The clearest line separating pseudoscience from “real” science is publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. These are publications, usually run by scientific societies or academic publishing companies, in which scientists publish their findings according to a well-established system of oversight. Before it gets published in such a journal, a piece of research is carefully reviewed by two or more researchers in the same field of study. The methods and logic of the paper are evaluated carefully, and if it makes bold or unusual claims, the study is subject to especially close scrutiny. Reviewers and editors may demand not just rewrites, but also additional evidence if a claim is weakly supported. Truly scientific research is published in reputable peer-reviewed journals. These journals exclude pseudoscience rigorously. If you hear that some idea is “scientifically proven,” check the source to see if there’s any reference to a scientific journal. Track down the article to see if it really supports the claim. Finally, double check to make sure that the publication is a respected peer-reviewed journal. One way to get this information is to ask a scientist at a research university, consult with a librarian, or do a careful Internet search. Your ability to distinguish between science and pseudoscience will help you be a scientifically literate citizen.

Science is both a body of factual knowledge and a process for understanding how the natural world works. When we use the term “natural” in this context, we mean all that can be observed with our senses or with instruments that extend our senses. Although there are many fields or disciplines within science, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry and physics, there are common activities in which scientists in all fields engage in order to explore and test natural phenomena. These activities include observation, measurement, comparison, predicting and hypothesizing, creating ideas and conceptual tools, and constructing explanations. Science Inquiry: A Method of Knowing To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called “scientific inquiry.” Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders.Today, with science-based medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900. The following characteristics define science and scientific inquiry, which is the process of exploration and development of knowledge in science: Science is based on empirical evidence. The word empirical refers to both qualitative and quantitative data that can be gathered through observation using the senses. In addition, technological tools such as microscopes, telescopes and computers can be used to enhance scientists’ ability to make observations. An inference is a logical interpretation of a scientist’s observations.While some scientific concepts may be theoretical in that they are derived primarily from logic and reasoning, ultimately all scientific ideas must conform to known observational or experimental data in order to be considered valid. Scientific processes are both creative and imaginative. Creativity and imagination are sources of innovation and inspiration in science. In fact, creativity and imagination are integral to all aspects of a scientist’s work – making sense of observations, making a creative leap from data to possible explanation, designing investigations, or looking at old data in new ways. Creativity and Imagination in Science An example of creativity in science is Barbara McClintock and her research on color patterns in corn kernels. In the early 20th century, scientists assumed genetic material was static and unchanging as it was passed from one generation to another. McClintock noticed that the color of corn kernels did not follow typical dominant-recessive inheritance patterns, which ran counter to the idea of stable genes, which was widely accepted at the time. Barbara McClintock used imagination to postulate the mechanism by which genes would move positions on chromosomes and effect the expression of neighboring genes. When observing corn chromosomes under a microscope, she noticed that DNA fragments regularly broke off, or disassociated, from a chromosome and reinserted itself into another chromosome. She called these segments of DNA “jumping genes” or transposable genetic elements (transposons). Later, she gathered evidence to show that when transposons changed positions on chromosomes, the color of corn kernels changed. Barbara McClintock discovered mobile pieces of DNA, called transposable elements, more than 60 years ago. Transposable elements affect the color of maize kernels and are responsible for the purple-colored sectors and spots shown in this 1949 ear of maize. Courtesy: National Science Foundation.  Robert Martienssen, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. McClintock had discovered that when transposons where present, they controlled the expression or inhibition of neighboring genes on a chromosome. The presence of transposons determined whether a corn kernel was yellow, brown, purple, or speckled. Although McClintock followed her creative intuition in making these discoveries in the 1950s, she didnot receive the Nobel Prize for her work until 1983. Subsequent research has shown the presence of transposons in the genetic material of almost all living organisms and these transposons serve as an important source of genetic variation. Another characteristic of science are the elements of objectivity and subjectivity that form the foundation of all scientists’ work. Scientists are skeptical and apply mechanisms such as peer review and crosschecking of new results with existing data to improve the accuracy of scientific knowledge. Skepticism and peer review are two ways in which scientists strive for objectivity in their work. Nonetheless, personal values and beliefs, intuition, academic training, experiences and expectations of scientists play a significant role in the development of scientific knowledge. Thus, there is inherently a degree of subjectivity reflected in all scientific observations, inferences and interpretations. Scientific knowledge is socially and culturally embedded. Science is a human enterprise and is practiced in the context of the culture at large. The social fabric of a society with its power structures, politics and economy all affect the types of research conducted by scientists, the way new scientific information is interpreted, and whether or not it is accepted. Science: Socially and Culturally Embedded An example of the social and cultural nature of science is stem cell research. Stem cell research has been hailed as the source of potential cures for several life-threatening diseases – Alzheimer’s, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Parkinson’s, cancer, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injuries. However, some people have moral objections to this type of research because one line of stem cells comes from human embryos. Human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) are harvested within a first few days of an embryos development. Removing HESCs from the developing embryo destroys it, thus raising the moral objection to stem cell research on the basis that it ends human life. A second type of non-embryonic stem cells have also been used in scientific research – these are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from adult tissues. Unlike HESCs, isolating and producing iPSCs from adult stem cells in a lab setting is challenging and methods for doing so are still undergoing investigation. In 2001, President George W. Bush instituted strict guidelines for federal funding of scientific research on hESCs. This policy required scientists essentially to halt the harvesting of hESCs for research and use only existing stem cell lines in their research. The policy slowed hESC research but catalyzed the discovery of iPSCsfrom adult cells. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order revoking Bush’s guidelines, which allowed scientists once again to pursue federal funding for research on hESCs, but only cell lines derived from unused embryos from fertility clinics. For more information, see “ Stem Cell Basics. In Stem Cell Information” and “Embryonic Stem Cell Research: A Decade of Debate from Bush to Obama.” Science is theory-laden. Theories and laws play a central role in the interpretation of new observations or discoveries. Scientific laws describe consistent relationships or patterns in nature. Scientific theories differ from colloquial or “everyday” theories. Scientific theories are well-supported explanations of natural phenomenon based on large bodies of empirical evidence. Everyday (colloquial) theories are most often based on a few untested personal experiences, anecdotal stories and legends. Last, both scientific laws and theories are widely accepted by scientists and change in light of new evidence. This means science and scientific knowledge is tentative but durable. Though reliable and durable, scientific theories and laws are subject to change in light of new data, and thus, are never absolute or static. When new discoveries are made, or additional data are gathered, scientific explanations change to reflect this new knowledge. Often, new discoveries are made possible by advances in thinking and technology. Despite the tentative nature of science, scientific knowledge is the most reliable body of knowledge we have about the natural world and how it works. Science is both a body of factual knowledge and a process for understanding how the natural world works. When we use the term “natural” in this context, we mean all that can be observed with our senses or with instruments that extend our senses. Although there are many fields or disciplines within science, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry and physics, there are common activities in which scientists in all fields engage in order to explore and test natural phenomena.

In addition, technological tools such as microscopes, telescopes and computers can be used to enhance scientists’ ability to make observations. An inference is a logical interpretation of a scientist’s observations.While some scientific concepts may be theoretical in that they are derived primarily from logic and reasoning, ultimately all scientific ideas must conform to known observational or experimental data in order to be considered valid. Scientific processes are both creative and imaginative. Creativity and imagination are sources of innovation and inspiration in science. In fact, creativity and imagination are integral to all aspects of a scientist’s work – making sense of observations, making a creative leap from data to possible explanation, designing investigations, or looking at old data in new ways. Creativity and Imagination in Science An example of creativity in science is Barbara McClintock and her research on color patterns in corn kernels. In the early 20th century, scientists assumed genetic material was static and unchanging as it was passed from one generation to another. McClintock noticed that the color of corn kernels did not follow typical dominant-recessive inheritance patterns, which ran counter to the idea of stable genes, which was widely accepted at the time. Barbara McClintock used imagination to postulate the mechanism by which genes would move positions on chromosomes and effect the expression of neighboring genes. When observing corn chromosomes under a microscope, she noticed that DNA fragments regularly broke off, or disassociated, from a chromosome and reinserted itself into another chromosome. She called these segments of DNA “jumping genes” or transposable genetic elements (transposons). Later, she gathered evidence to show that when transposons changed positions on chromosomes, the color of corn kernels changed. Barbara McClintock discovered mobile pieces of DNA, called transposable elements, more than 60 years ago. Transposable elements affect the color of maize kernels and are responsible for the purple-colored sectors and spots shown in this 1949 ear of maize.

McClintock had discovered that when transposons where present, they controlled the expression or inhibition of neighboring genes on a chromosome. The presence of transposons determined whether a corn kernel was yellow, brown, purple, or speckled. Although McClintock followed her creative intuition in making these discoveries in the 1950s, she didnot receive the Nobel Prize for her work until 1983. Subsequent research has shown the presence of transposons in the genetic material of almost all living organisms and these transposons serve as an important source of genetic variation. Another characteristic of science are the elements of objectivity and subjectivity that form the foundation of all scientists’ work. Scientists are skeptical and apply mechanisms such as peer review and crosschecking of new results with existing data to improve the accuracy of scientific knowledge. Skepticism and peer review are two ways in which scientists strive for objectivity in their work. Nonetheless, personal values and beliefs, intuition, academic training, experiences and expectations of scientists play a significant role in the development of scientific knowledge. Thus, there is inherently a degree of subjectivity reflected in all scientific observations, inferences and interpretations. Scientific knowledge is socially and culturally embedded. Science is a human enterprise and is practiced in the context of the culture at large. The social fabric of a society with its power structures, politics and economy all affect the types of research conducted by scientists, the way new scientific information is interpreted, and whether or not it is accepted. Science: Socially and Culturally Embedded An example of the social and cultural nature of science is stem cell research. Stem cell research has been hailed as the source of potential cures for several life-threatening diseases – Alzheimer’s, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Parkinson’s, cancer, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injuries. However, some people have moral objections to this type of research because one line of stem cells comes from human embryos. Human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) are harvested within a first few days of an embryos development. Removing HESCs from the developing embryo destroys it, thus raising the moral objection to stem cell research on the basis that it ends human life. A second type of non-embryonic stem cells have also been used in scientific research – these are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from adult tissues. Unlike HESCs, isolating and producing iPSCs from adult stem cells in a lab setting is challenging and methods for doing so are still undergoing investigation. In 2001, President George W. Bush instituted strict guidelines for federal funding of scientific research on hESCs. This policy required scientists essentially to halt the harvesting of hESCs for research and use only existing stem cell lines in their research. The policy slowed hESC research but catalyzed the discovery of iPSCsfrom adult cells. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order revoking Bush’s guidelines, which allowed scientists once again to pursue federal funding for research on hESCs, but only cell lines derived from unused embryos from fertility clinics. For more information, see “ Stem Cell Basics. In Stem Cell Information” and “Embryonic Stem Cell Research: A Decade of Debate from Bush to Obama.” Science is theory-laden. Theories and laws play a central role in the interpretation of new observations or discoveries. Scientific laws describe consistent relationships or patterns in nature. Scientific theories differ from colloquial or “everyday” theories. Scientific theories are well-supported explanations of natural phenomenon based on large bodies of empirical evidence. Everyday (colloquial) theories are most often based on a few untested personal experiences, anecdotal stories and legends. Last, both scientific laws and theories are widely accepted by scientists and change in light of new evidence. This means science and scientific knowledge is tentative but durable. Though reliable and durable, scientific theories and laws are subject to change in light of new data, and thus, are never absolute or static. When new discoveries are made, or additional data are gathered, scientific explanations change to reflect this new knowledge. Often, new discoveries are made possible by advances in thinking and technology. Despite the tentative nature of science, scientific knowledge is the most reliable body of knowledge we have about the natural world and how it works.

Application Spotlight: Bees and the Community Bees and Community Interactions A fly that Parasitizes Honeybees Fly parasites that may help explain colony collapse disorder in honeybees. The figure above shows an adult fly (A), a fly laying its eggs on a bee host (B), and the larvae emerging from the host (C). (Core et al., 2012) People are concerned about ecological community interactions for many reasons. For example, animal pollinators help us produce crops including almonds, soybeans, apples, tomatoes, coffee, cotton, and many more. In fact, over a third of global crop production depends on animal pollinators. Many of these crops are pollinated by domesticated honeybees. Originally native to Eurasia, honeybees were brought to North America by the earliest European settlers. Native Americans are said to have called them the “white man’s fly.” Honeybees and other pollinators transfer pollen from one flower to another, helping to increase seed and fruit yield. Ongoing declines in bee populations are a major focus for ecological research. Since about 2006, North American beekeepers have been plagued by a complex problem called colony collapse disorder, in which worker bees abandon their hives. Research has implicated parasitic mites, viruses, pesticides, and other factors in causing bee colony declines. In 2012 scientists documented another threat: honeybees are being parasitized by a fly that was not previously known to interact with them. The fly lays its eggs on worker bees and its larvae live within bees, feeding on their body tissues. When the fly larvae are mature, the worker bee hostswander away from their hives at night and die away from the colony. The fly larvae then abandon the host, beheading it as they exit. Even the gory interaction with decapitating flies probably cannot explain colony collapse disorder all by itself. Instead, experts agree that many factors have likely worked together to threaten bees. As we learn more about the habitat needs of bees and threats to their existence, we may be able to find ways to protect them. In this way, biologists hope to reinforce the ancient mutualism between bees, crop plants, and food producers.

PLoS ONE 7(4): e35954.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035954   Application Spotlight: Medical Imaging Scientists have learned to use isotopes in many different ways. For example, stable isotopes can be used to trace chemical reactions through a food web. For example, if a stable isotope is used in fertilizer, that same isotope will later show up in the tissues of plants, then in animals, and finally in decomposers as the nutrient moves through the food web. Other isotopes are unstable and they tend to decay (or break down into other isotopes) at a constant rate. Scientists have learned how to use unstable isotopes to determine the age of fossils or artifacts. Finally, some isotopes are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes emit energy in the form of radiation when they decay into different isotopes. Radioactive isotopes can be used to visualize certain tissues for medical diagnosis. One example of this is radioactive iodine, which tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland. It emits radiation as it breaks down to another isotope of iodine. Special cameras can pick up this radiation and use it to create an image of the thyroid gland to determine if the patient's thyroid is functioning normally. If there is abnormal activity in the thyroid gland, this can indicate cancer. Another example of radioactive isotopes is positron-emission tomography (PET). In PET, a patient ingests sugar that is marked with a radioactive isotope. Cells that are using a lot of sugar (or need a lot of energy) will absorb more of the radioactive isotope. The patient is then moved into a PET scanner, where the radioactive isotopes are visualized and the machine translates the data into an image. This can help in a variety of applications, from cancer and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis to addiction research (see image). Positron-Emission Tomography (PET)Images PET brain scans show chemical differences in the brain between addicts and nonaddicts. The normal images in the bottom row come from nonaddicts; the abnormal images in the top row come from patients with addiction disorders. These PET brain scans show that addicts have fewer than average dopamine receptors in their brains, so that weaker dopamine signals are sent between cells.

The story of acids and bases begins with water (H2O). Water in the liquid state is highly dynamic. Not only are the hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules constantly forming and breaking, but some of the individual water molecules are breaking apart into hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) and reforming to make water. The two reactions (breaking apart and reforming) are in equilibrium, so at any instant in a sample of pure water there are equal proportions of H+ and OH- Pure water is said to be “neutral” (neither acidic nor basic) because it has equal concentrations of H+ and OH-. When some compounds are dissolved into water, they disturb this balance. Some compounds release extra hydrogen ions (H+) into the solution. These compounds are called acids. Other compounds remove hydrogen ions (H+) from the solution when they are combined with water. These compounds are called bases. Some bases accept H+ directly, but others release hydroxide ions (OH-) that then combine with H+ to produce water. The end result is the same. When the base is dissolved in water, the concentration of H+ ions goes down. A compound that does not result in a net gain or loss of hydrogen ions (H+) when in aqueous solution is said to be neutral, it does not alter the acidity of the water. Acids and Bases in Solution This figure shows what acids and bases look like in aqueous solution. Notice that the concentration of hydrogen ions is greater than the concentration of hydroxide ions in an acid, the concentration of the hydrogen ions equals that of the hydroxide ions in the neutral solution, and the concentration of the hydrogen ions is less than the concentration of hydroxide ions in the base. This table compares and contrasts the features of acids and bases. Acids Bases Readily give hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water Readily take hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water; may donate hydroxide ions (OH-) Acidic foods often taste sour Basic foods often taste bitter Many foods and beverages are acidic Bases often make your skin feel slimy or slippery. Soap is a basic substance. Strong acids can cause burns and are caustic Strong bases can cause burns and are caustic Acids commonly induce damage to living organisms by denaturing proteins: changing their shape so they do not function normally Bases commonly induce damage to living organisms by breaking down fats and denaturing proteins Understanding acids and bases is important to biology because living organisms must maintain homeostasis (balance) and cannot tolerate drastic changes in the acidity of their body fluids or cytoplasm. Cellular functions are disrupted if these fluids become too acidic or basic. The pH Scale The acidity of a solution is measured on the pH scale. pH is a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. You can think of pH as “parts Hydrogen ion,” but remember that the pH scale is “backwards.” The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 with zero being the most acidic (highest concentration of H+) and fourteen being the most basic. Neutral solutions (like pure water) have a pH of 7. Solutions with pH measurements below 7 are acidic while solutions with pH measurement above 7 are basic. A solution at pH 7 is neutral because at that pH the number of hydrogen ions (H+) equals the number of hydroxide ions (OH-), just as they are balanced in pure water. The pH scale is logarithmic. This means that the difference between each unit is 10-fold. Starting at pH 7, a solution at pH 6 would have 10 times more H+ than the neutral solution. On the other hand, a solution at pH 8 would have 10 times fewer H+ than the solution with pH 7. If you skip a few units, the differences between solutions become very great indeed. Lemon juice (pH 2) has 1 million times more H+ ions per unit volume than seawater, which has a pH of about 8.

Hydrogen ion concentration can vary over many orders of magnitude. To represent very large differences in concentration levels a logarithmic mathematical function is used to denote the pH scale. The pH scale is the -log of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log[H+]. The log conversion reduces a 10 fold change in hydrogen ion concentration to a one unit change in pH. The minus sign changes the negative numbers that would be obtained from log[H+] to positive ones. Thus, starting at pH 7, a solution at pH 6 would have 10 times more H+ than a neutral solution.

Acid and Base Neutralization If an acid gives a hydrogen ion (H+) in solution and a base accepts a hydrogen ion by giving a hydroxide ion (OH-), you may be wondering what will happen when an acid and a base are combined. Let’s consider the combination of equal amounts of hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base. When the hydrogen ion (H+) is released from hydrochloric acid, and the hydroxide ion (OH-) is released from sodium hydroxide, the two ions combine to form water (HOH). Water, as you know, has a neutral pH, so the process of combining an acid and a base is called neutralization. Remember, in a neutral solution (like water) the number of hydrogen ions equals the number of hydroxide ions. The remaining sodium ion (Na+) from the sodium hydroxide and the remaining chloride ion (Cl-) from the hydrochloric acid also stay in solution as dissolved table salt (NaCl). This process can be written as it is below: HCl + NaOH ➨ HOH + NaCl Notice that the same four atoms (H, Cl, Na, and OH) are found on each side of the equation. Using this example we can generalize the process of neutralization as follows: acid + base ➨ water + salt (in solution) The process of neutralization also gives off heat, indicating that chemical potential energy is being released during the course of the reaction. Neutralization has many useful applications. One such application in the laboratory is to neutralize strong acids or bases so that they can safely be disposed of. As you will learn later in this course, the addition of acids and bases to the environment leads to ecosystem damage, so before a strong acid or base can be disposed of, it must be neutralized (to make water and salt) to prevent injuries or environmental damage. In your everyday life you may be familiar with acid and base neutralization through your lawn care and gardening activities. Grass grows best in a very mildly acidic soil (pH 6.5 to 7). So if your soil is too acidic (less than pH 6.5), you would need to add a compound like limestone (a basic mineral) to your soil to neutralize the excess acidity and correct the pH level. Likewise, if your soil is too basic (pH above 7), you would need to add sulfur, which interacts with water in the soil to form sulfuric acid, to help neutralize the excess base in the soil. Another common application of neutralization is the standard volcano science fair project, where a mixture of vinegar (an acid) and baking soda (a base) are combined to make the volcano "erupt." In this case, the reaction releases some carbon dioxide gas, generating fizz and fun. If you ever come into contact with a strong acid or base and receive a chemical burn, DO NOT attempt your own science experiment to try and neutralize the compound. The damage to your skin is already occurring and can be exacerbated by adding more chemicals; a vigorous neutralization reaction could cause further harm through the release of heat, causing a physical burn on top of the chemical burn already suffered. Your safest option is to wash the affected area under a heavy stream of running water, and to seek medical attention for your burn. The goal is to remove the agent causing the burn to prevent further damage.   Measuring pH One of the ways that scientists can measure the pH of a solution is to use indicator paper. This is special paper that is infused with dyes that change color when placed in an acid or a base. The most simple indicator paper is called litmus paper. Litmus paper comes in two colors - red and blue. Red litmus paper turns blue in the presence of a base (it does not chance color in the presence of an acid). Blue litmus paper turns red in the presence of an acid (it does not change color in the presence of a base). In the presence of a neutral solution red litmus paper remains red, and blue litmus paper remains blue. Litmus Paper Experiment Lotisha is a biology student who is learning about acids and bases. One of her lab assignments was to determine if bleach, vinegar, and water are acidic, basic, or neutral. She decides that she is going to use red and blue litmus paper to test these solutions. Lotisha poured each solution into a separate beaker, and dipped both red and blue litmus paper into each beaker. Observe her results to determine whether each substance is acidic, basic or neutral. pH Scale In the following activity, determine the pH of these common substances by dragging them to the appropriate box on the pH scale.

Buffers: Why pH Matters Living organisms are quite sensitive to even small changes in pH. The chemical reactions of life are tuned to a specific and often narrow pH range; outside this range, the reactions will not proceed normally. Therefore, organisms have mechanisms that work to maintain a constant pH level. This is true both at the cellular level and at the level of the whole organism. Maintaining a stable pH in a living organism is an important part of homeostasis. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism (or cell) to maintain stable internal conditions despite constantly changing environmental conditions. Buffers One way in which changes in pH are moderated is through the use of buffers. Buffers are aqueous solutions that can resist changes in pH. When an acid or a base is added to a solution containing a buffer, the pH of the solution will only exhibit a very minor change. Blood is a buffered solution. The liquid portion of blood contains carbonic acid (H2CO3). It dissociates (breaks apart) to produce bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+). This reaction is easily reversible. If acid enters the blood (H+ concentration goes up), most of the excess hydrogen ions will bond with bicarbonate, restoring carbonic acid. If a base enters the blood, the H+ concentration will initially go down. But then carbonic acid will dissociate to replace the “missing” hydrogen ions. Thus the easily reversible reaction works to oppose any pH change in the blood. A buffered solution cannot absorb an unlimited amount of acid or base. As acid or base is added, any buffered solution will eventually reach a limit called the “buffering capacity.” At this point, no additional hydrogen ions can be absorbed or produced, and the buffer stops working. The solution’s pH will change rapidly if further acid or base is added. One way in which changes in pH are moderated is through the use of buffers.

If a base enters the blood, the H+ concentration will initially go down. But then carbonic acid will dissociate to replace the “missing” hydrogen ions. Thus the easily reversible reaction works to oppose any pH change in the blood. A buffered solution cannot absorb an unlimited amount of acid or base. As acid or base is added, any buffered solution will eventually reach a limit called the “buffering capacity.” At this point, no additional hydrogen ions can be absorbed or produced, and the buffer stops working. The solution’s pH will change rapidly if further acid or base is added.   Application Spotlight: pH and Human Health While maintaining a pH close to neutral is usually the goal of homeostasis, there are certain conditions and parts of organisms that are maintained at a lower (more acidic) pH. For instance, the process of digestion is aided by the presence of stomach acid (pH 2). Not only does stomach acid help to break down the compounds in our food, it also helps to prevent disease by killing many of the bacteria and viruses found in food and water. Lysosomes, digestive organelles found in eukaryotic cells, have an internal pH of about 5. Again this acidic environment is used to break down cellular food, waste, and even invading bacteria. Likewise, the surface of our skin is acidic (pH of 4.5 to 6), which helps to support the growth of our normal bacterial flora, as well as to help prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria. When the normal pH levels of the body are disrupted, there are detriments to the health of the organism. For instance, the female vaginal tract is moderately acidic, with a pH between 3.8 and 4.5. When the pH increases in this area of the body (becomes more basic), women are more prone to bacterial infections of the vagina. Conversely, if the pH decreases (becomes more acidic), women are more prone to yeast infections. Diabetic Ketoacidosis A higher-stakes example of loss of pH regulation occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis. In people with diabetes, cells cannot take up glucose (sugar) from the blood efficiently. As a result, cells switch from using glucose (sugar) as a fuel source and use fatty acids (fats) instead. When fatty acids are broken down, ketone acids are produced as a by-product. In healthy individuals, a small amount of ketone acids are released by normal metabolic processes; for example, if you are losing weight, fat breakdown will add some ketone acids to your bloodstream. This poses no problem because your blood is buffered, and your liver and kidneys are able to remove the excess acids before they cause problems. However, in people with diabetes, chronic release of ketone acids can overwhelm these systems. Ketone acids build up in the blood and urine, leading to a condition called ketoacidosis. The presence of excess ketone acids lowers the body’s pH, leading to several health problems as detailed on the figure below. If the pH balance is not restored, diabetics in ketoacidosis can face serious harm and even death. Treatment consists of restoring proper insulin levels in the body (so that carbohydrates can be absorbed by cells and used as a fuel source) and ensuring proper hydration (to help the kidneys flush out the excess ketones). Symptoms of Acidosis This figure shows the symptoms of acidosis in the body broken down by organ system. Notice that the symptoms range from mild to severe. In the long term, these symptoms can become life threatening.   Application Spotlight: pH and the Environment While it is clear that the regulation of pH in living organisms is crucial to their survival, the pH in the environment is just as important to maintaining life on this planet. Different environments have different pH levels, and organisms that live in those locations have adapted to those conditions. When environmental pH levels are disrupted, the health and vitality of the ecosystem becomes threatened. Seawater As you have learned, seawater is slightly basic at pH 8. The oceans and the organisms that live in them play a critical role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide on this planet. You will learn more about this in the Photosynthesis / Cellular Respiration module in the Metabolism unit. With the increased burning of fossil fuels in the modern industrial society, more man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is being released into the environment than ever before. Much of this carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans. When carbon dioxide is absorbed into water, carbonic acid is produced. This then dissociates to produce bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, and the pH of the ocean is lowered. Acidification of the ocean threatens the health of the organisms that call the ocean home. Many marine life forms, including reef-building corals, are harmed or killed when ocean water is acidified. As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere continue to climb, there is great concern about the worsening impact of ocean acidification. Effects of Acid on Coral Reefs Figure A shows a healthy vibrant coral reef. Notice the bright colors and water clarity. Figure B shows a dying coral reef. Notice the dull, black color of the reef and the poor water quality. Coral reefs are made up of millions of tiny living organisms and provide shelter, food, and nesting grounds to other marine animals. The death of coral reefs due to ocean acidification and other factors is a matter of grave concern to marine biologists and to those who depend on ocean ecosystems. Acid Rain Another environmental problem involving pH balance is acid rain. When nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, two common by-products of burning fossil fuels, combine with water in the Earth’s atmosphere, acid rain is produced. In some regions, acid rain reduces the pH of fresh water sources like streams, rivers, and lakes. It also may change soil chemistry and harm plants. Some regions have rocks and soils that contain buffers, and they are less susceptible to damage from acid rain. However, when soil buffering capacity is exhausted (buffers cannot accept any more hydrogen ions), pH may decline very quickly. Tighter regulations on coal-burning power plants have helped reduce the acid rain problem in recent decades, but it remains a threat to some forest and aquatic ecosystems and the organisms living within them. We will learn more about acid rain in the Ecology unit.   Application Spotlight: Carbohydrates and Health Indigestible carbohydrates, which cannot be degraded by human digestive enzymes, are referred to as dietary fiber. Cellulose, mentioned above as a major component of plant cell walls, is one of the largest contributors of dietary fiber. Pectin is another structural carbohydrate found in most plants, especially apples and citrus fruits, and is commonly used as a gelling agent to make jams and jellies. A diet high in fiber has several benefits. Dietary fiber plays a role in maintaining regular digestive functioning, slowing the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, and reducing bad cholesterol. So the old saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” does have some truth to it, since there are proven health benefits associated with the consumption of foods that are high in fiber, like apples. Other foods that are high in fiber are oatmeal, popcorn, raspberries, black beans, lentils, and peas, to name a few. For a quick boost of energy, simple sugars are the carbohydrate of choice; diabetics will oftentimes carry a sugary food or drink with them in case their blood sugar level drops too low. However, excessively high blood sugar levels can be equally dangerous. Accordingly, doctors routinely suggest that diabetics eat a diet high in fiber to help manage their diabetes, since fiber helps to slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, which helps diabetics to prevent spikes in blood sugar. In contrast with simple sugars, complex carbohydrates are broken down by the body more slowly and energy is released in a stepwise fashion.

Nucleic Acids: Summary   Waxes Waxes are nonpolar lipids that form protective layers on plants and animals. For example, waxes cover the feathers of some aquatic birds to keep the feathers dry. Plants, on the other hand, often have leaves coated with waxes to prevent water from evaporating off the plant surface. Because of their hydrophobic nature, waxes prevent water from sticking on the surface of these structures. Wax: "Esterified" Fatty Acid Chain Chemical structure of cetyl palmitate, a typical wax ester. The chemical structure of a wax is linked to its function. Waxes are the simplest lipids in nature, consisting of two long hydrocarbon chains linked in the middle by an ester group. It is this structure that enables waxes to function the way they do in living systems.   Steroids Steroids are a family of lipids based on a molecular structure with four fused carbon rings. This family of lipids includes many hormones and cholesterol. Hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone) are used by some animals as long-distance messengers. This means that they are produced by cells in one part of the body and affect cells in a different part of the body. Steroids — including cholesterol, testosterone, vitamin D2, and cortisol — are characterized by four fused hydrocarbon rings. The chemical groups attached to these carbon rings are what distinguishes different types of steroids: (A) shows a molecule of cholesterol; (B) shows a molecule of testosterone; (C) shows cortisol; and ( D) shows vitamin D2. Cholesterol is an example of a familiar steroid that plays many important roles in your body. While most people are familiar with cholesterol, they often don’t realize how important it is for healthy function. In fact, most of the cholesterol in your body is synthesized by your liver. Cholesterol has many functions. Cholesterol is used to build steroid hormones, including testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the sex organs. Cholesterol is also the precursor to vitamins D and K. Some cholesterol is converted to bile salts, which help in the absorption of fats from the digestive system into the body. Cholesterol is also used by animals to maintain the proper consistency of the cell membrane, which is the structure that surrounds every cell. Other organisms use different steroids for this function. For example, plants use a steroid called stigmasterol, while fungi use ergosterol.   Application Spotlight: Cholesterol in the Human Body Although some cholesterol is essential for healthy physiological functioning, excess cholesterol can lead to health problems. Because cholesterol is hydrophobic, it cannot be easily transported through the body in the blood stream. A carrier is required to transport cholesterol around the body to the cells that need it. These carriers are called lipoproteins. You can think of lipoproteins as cholesterol boats that carry cholesterol to the body’s cells (where it can be used to build or repair cell membranes or synthesize steroid hormones). Lipoproteins that carry cholesterol to the cell for use are called low-density lipoproteins (or LDL). LDL is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, because excess LDL levels have been linked to plaque deposition in the arteries, which can result in heart disease. Another type of lipoprotein, known as high-density lipoprotein (or HDL) transports cholesterol to the liver, where it is often turned into bile salts and excreted. HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol, because high blood concentrations of HDL have been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease. Exercise and proper diet can increase HDL levels. Increasing intake of unsaturated fats and decreasing intake of saturated fats is also a good strategy for increasing HDL levels. Cholesterol by the Numbers Given what you know about the function and structure of cholesterol, why would deposits within the arteries be bad? Examine the table below providing interpretation of cholesterol numbers including LDL and HDL. Recommended Lipoprotein Levels for the USA Cholesterol numbers measured in milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) of blood. Table modified from "Cholesterol levels: What numbers should you aim for?" June 1, 2011; Mayo Clinic.   Phospholipids Phospholipids are an important class of lipids found in the membranes of all cells and organelles. A phospholipid contains only two fatty acids attached to a glycerol, which in turn is bound to a phosphate group. Together, the phosphate and the glycerol make up the “head” of the phospholipid. The fatty acids make up the molecule’s “tail.” The phosphate group carries a negative charge and is therefore hydrophilic. The tail, on the other hand, is made up of nonpolar fatty acids and, like other lipids, is hydrophobic. Thus phospholipids, like fatty acids, are amphipathic. An amphipathic molecule has both a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end. A phospholipid is made of two fatty acids and a phosphate group attached to glycerol. For simplicity, phospholipids are often drawn as a circle to indicate the phosphate group and 2 chains to indicate the fatty acids.   Fats and Oils Structure and Function of Triglycerides Fats and oils are called triglycerides because they are made of three (“tri”) fatty acids attached to one glycerol. A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid, a charged polar functional group, that contains a long hydrocarbon chain. The fatty acids are usually 16 to 22 carbons long, but can range from 4 to 36 carbons in length. In one triglyceride there are three fatty acid tails (shown on the right). Each is connected by a covalent bond to one of the three oxygen atoms of a glycerol group. Fats are mainly energy storage and insulating molecules. Per gram, fats contain twice as much energy as carbohydrates. Layers of fat also surround the vital organs of animals to help cushion and protect them. In some animals, layers of fat under the skin provide insulation. This is particularly true of marine endotherms (i.e., organisms that maintain internal body temperature using their own metabolism) that live in cold polar regions, like penguins, whales, and seals. These are all examples of animals with thick insulating “blubber” beneath the skin. Saturated and Unsaturated Fats In one triglyceride there are three fatty acids. All of these can be the same, or there can be two or three different types of fatty acids in a single triglyceride. The fat’s properties depend on the types of fatty acids that are present. In saturated fatty acids, all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds and each carbon is bonded to two or three H atoms; each carbon is “saturated” with hydrogen. Because all the bonds are single, the entire fatty acid can adopt a linear shape. Unsaturated fatty acids have one, two, or even three double bonds along the carbon “backbone.” Notice in the diagram below that at each double bond, the carbons involved are bonded to only one instead of two hydrogen atoms. Thus these fatty acids have less hydrogen; they are “unsaturated” with respect to hydrogen. The double bonds found in the unsaturated fatty acids have an effect on the overall shape of a triglyceride: unsaturated fatty acids are normally “kinked,” because the double bond prevents free rotation between the two carbons involved. Three 12-carbon fatty acids are shown. The top structure, lauric acid, is fully saturated. The two lower structures are unsaturated fatty acids, each with a double bond. The cis (left) form is typically found in biological lipids. In cis unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrocarbon chain is kinked at each double bond. The trans (right) form is generated artificially by a process that is used to convert liquid vegetable oil to solid margarine. In trans fatty acids, the double bond is rotated so that the fatty acid is relatively straight. Saturated fats have three saturated fatty acid “tails” — all of which are linear in shape. With their compact shape, saturated fat molecules pack together efficiently and form a solid at room temperature. These are usually produced by animals; everyday examples of saturated fats include lard and real butter. Unsaturated fats have at least one unsaturated fatty acid. With their “kinky” fatty acid(s), unsaturated fats will not pack into a regular structure and thus remain fluid at room temperature. They are called oils, and are commonly produced by plants; everyday examples include olive oil, corn oil, and canola oil. Fats and oils are called triglycerides because they are made of three (“tri”) fatty acids attached to one glycerol.

They are called oils, and are commonly produced by plants; everyday examples include olive oil, corn oil, and canola oil.   Trans Fats A diet rich in saturated fats may contribute to formation of plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increase your risk of heart disease. To reduce this risk, it is recommended that you replace some foods rich in saturated fats (e.g. fatty cuts of pork, beef, and high-fat dairy products like butter) with foods that provide unsaturated fats (available in foods like olive oil, canola oil, seafood, and walnuts). Such a shift is believed to help improve blood cholesterol levels and may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical Properties of Saturated and Unsaturated Fats In the diagram above, you see the physical behavior of two different triglycerides (with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) at three distinct temperatures. Figure 1 shows that at a temperature of 0oC (freezing), both types of fatty acids stack neatly. At 16oC (Fig. 2), the unsaturated fatty acids lose the tightly stacked formation and become more mobile. At 70oC, the saturated fatty acids also become mobile (Fig.3). At 27oC (room temperature) and at 37oC (body temperature), triglycerides with unsaturated fatty acids are liquid oils, whereas saturated fats remain solid. Trans Fats Since the early 20th century, modified vegetable oils have been produced that are solid at room temperature. Examples include margarine and vegetable shortening. To make these products, a chemical process is used to add hydrogen to vegetable oil. Many of the double bonds in the fatty acids are replaced by single bonds (and hydrogen atoms), but some double bonds remain in the partially hydrogenated oils that result. This process increases shelf-life and produces flaky rather than crumbly crusts when used for baking. As a side effect of the chemical transformation, the orientation of some of the remaining double bonds is shifted. The naturally occurring double bonds are converted to trans double bonds, making "trans fats." Historically, it was believed that synthetic trans unsaturated fats would be as “good for you” as natural unsaturated fats. However, recent studies have shown that consumption of trans fat may pose a significant health risk. Consuming a lot of trans fat can lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This in turn is associated with a higher risk of heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and many products have been reformulated so that they are much lower in trans fats. However, trans fats are still a common ingredient in many processed foods; close reading of ingredient and nutrition labels is recommended.   Eukaryotic Organelle Functions Review   Application Spotlight: Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems in children and adults. While there is no cure for the condition, in the 1950’s, people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis were lucky if they lived long enough to go to elementary school. Medical research has made an enormous difference in the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis, and today, they routinely live into their thirties and forties. A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is suspected if a patient has chronic weight loss accompanied by problems with the respiratory system. Most people with the condition are diagnosed by the time they are two years old. A century ago, cystic fibrosis was diagnosed when a doctor licked the forehead of a patient and found it to be unusually salty. While the medical equipment used to diagnose the condition today is much more professional, the same symptoms are identified. People with CF exhibit a variety of symptoms that may include: persistent coughing often heavy with mucous; frequent respiratory infections; wheezing and shortness of breath; excessive appetite but poor weight gain; unusually salty-tasting skin; and greasy, bulky stools. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a malfunctioning transport protein called Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a channel that allows for the passage of chloride ions (Cl-) into and out of the cell. CFTR is located in the cells that line the respiratory tract, the pancreas, and sweat glands. It allows for the movement of Cl- into or out of a cell. CFTR is an active transporter and requires energy in the form of ATP to function. Analyzing CF Symptoms People with cystic fibrosis have unusually salty sweat. Sweat glands are tubes embedded in the skin that are lined with special cells that reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from the sweat as it moves toward the surface of the skin. The channel responsible for reabsorbing chloride ions is CFTR. Human Skin A cross section of human skin, with sweat glands shown in yellow. The sweat gland is a coiled tube lined in epithelial cells. These cells have CFTR transporters in their membranes that remove chloride ions from the sweat (Beddard, 1902) . Effect of Malfunctioning Membrane Transporters People with cystic fibrosis have respiratory difficulties, usually caused by unusually thick mucus in the respiratory tubes in the lungs. In the lungs, CFTR transporters secrete chloride ions into the center of the respiratory tubes. This increases the concentration of solutes in the mucus lining the tubes, which in turn causes water to flow into the space inside the tubes (yellow). Under normal conditions, this process allows for a runny mucus to line the tubes. Human Lungs The lungs function by allowing air to flow through a series of tubes (yellow) that culminate in tiny sacs where gas exchange occurs. The yellow tubes are lined with special cells that have CFTR transporters in them that secrete chloride ions into the air tubes. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Most of the treatments for cystic fibrosis involve making sure the lungs remain clear of the thick, sticky mucus. This can be done using drugs that thin the respiratory mucus, like Pulmozyme. A more recently discovered treatment involves the inhalation of hypertonic saline solution. This salty solution causes water to move from the cells and into the airways (via osmosis), making the mucus more watery and easier to cough up.

Mitosis: Process Review Use the activities on this page to review the process of mitosis. Do the activities as many times as you’d like, until you feel comfortable with the whole process. Mitosis in Action Watch the animation below, which illustrates and describes each phase of mitosis. By Cookatoo.ergo.ZooM Mitosis Phases and Functions Perform the following activity to depict each phase of mitosis. By University of Maryland University College CC-BY-NC.   Application Spotlight: Aneuploidy When the Chromosome Number is Not Right Aneuploidy is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. It is caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when chromosomes fail to separate properly during anaphase. Genetic problems caused by nondisjunction can be diagnosed prenatally by studying the fetus’ karyotype. A karyotype is a visual representation of the chromosomes of an individual, obtained from a small sample of cells. In fetuses, this is usually obtained from sampling either the amniotic liquid (amniocentesis) or the placenta. Karyotype of a Normal Human Male Courtesy of the National Human Genome Research Institute In nondisjunction, chromosomes are not separated correctly during metaphase I or II, resulting in gametes with too few or too many chromosomes. There are many genetic disorders associated with incorrect chromosome numbers. One of the most well known condition caused by nondisjunction is Down syndrome. Down syndrome results from nondisjunction of chromosome 21, resulting in a child with 3 copies of this chromosome (trisomy 21). Down syndrome appears in approximately 1 of every 1,000 children, and older women are at a higher risk of having babies with the condition. Chromosomal abnormalities can include sex chromosomes also. For example, males with Klinefelter syndrome have an extra X chromosome (XXY), and females with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome (X_). Both these conditions are relatively benign and can be corrected with hormone treatment. Note that nondisjunction due to lack of separation of sister chromatids can occur also during mitosis.

BMI and Obesity Body mass index (BMI) provides an approximation of total body fat based upon height and weight, and can be used to identify potential weight problems for adults (both males and females). However, you must be careful when dealing with BMI. A BMI score alone is not enough for a diagnosis. BMI does not distinguish between bone/muscle weight and excessive body fat. Some people with heavy bone structure or highly developed muscle may be rated as overweight or obese, despite having little body fat. However, for people of average stature and fitness, the BMI is a reasonable indicator of body fat. Insert your height and weight to have your body mass index (BMI) calculated. Then use the BMI chart (Figure 8.1) below to place yourself within the category of “normal,” “overweight,” or “obese.” Body Mass Index chart. Find your weight in pounds or kilograms (top or bottom horizontal scales) and trace across to your height in meters or feet and inches (left or right vertical scales). Categories are regions filled with white (underweight), yellow (normal weight), orange (overweight), and pink (obese). _m3_bmi_obese_LBD What does your score mean? If you are underweight, do not pat yourself on the back. It is important that you have adequate body fat and muscle, and your low weight may be a sign of a serious problem. You should see a doctor and focus on the important end goal: your long-term health. For additional information about how to respond to an overweight or obese rating, visit the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s webpage on Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.   Regulation and Human Health To this point, you have learned much about how pathways work. They proceed as a series of steps catalyzed by enzymes. They are regulated by factors that modify enzymes or alter the expression of genes. In living organisms, metabolic processes are tightly regulated under normal conditions. The cell, and the organism as a whole (e.g., the human body), tend to respond to external influences in ways that maintain a relatively stable internal environment. This ability or tendency is called homeostasis and depends on a complex set of stabilizing responses. Cells live in dynamic environments. Therefore, it takes work to keep conditions stable in a cell. Precise regulation enables the cell (or body) to establish consistent internal conditions. Factors like pH, ion concentrations, and levels of various substrates and products are held within narrow bounds. This unique environment allows a diverse set of reactions to take place. Many of these chemical reactions are essential for life and all of them help maintain overall health. Applications of Metabolic Regulation to Human Health You had to work at staying upright because your body was in motion. In the cell or inside a body, countless dynamic processes are running at once. Many of them could easily disturb internal chemistry and throw things out of whack. So could changes in the external environment. As a result, many levels of regulation are constantly at work within your body, keeping internal processes balanced and compensating for external changes. These concepts are not just academic, textbook issues. To the contrary! Many of today’s most challenging health problems center on the regulation of metabolism. The loss of proper regulation can result in a number of diseases or disorders. Substances that inhibit enzymes in a central pathway can have deadly effects for the cell or organism. For instance, the potent poisons cyanide and arsenic are inhibitors of cellular respiration. Lack of regulation, or dysregulation, of metabolic pathways can lead to serious diseases. Examples include phenylketonuria (PKU), Tay-Sachs disease, galactosemia, and maple syrup urine disease. Each of these is an inherited condition in which an altered gene produces an enzyme that does not function normally. As a result, metabolism is disrupted and health problems occur. On the other hand, drugs often target metabolic pathways to correct diseases. For instance, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that are commonly used to control high blood pressure. These drugs inhibit ACE; the result is reduced production of angiotensin, a molecule that increases blood pressure. You had to work at staying upright because your body was in motion.

Each of these is an inherited condition in which an altered gene produces an enzyme that does not function normally. As a result, metabolism is disrupted and health problems occur. On the other hand, drugs often target metabolic pathways to correct diseases. For instance, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that are commonly used to control high blood pressure. These drugs inhibit ACE; the result is reduced production of angiotensin, a molecule that increases blood pressure.   Application Spotlight: Energy Balance and Excess Weight Many humans are able to maintain a stable adult body weight over a large number of years. Although it may seem perfectly normal, this is an amazing feat of metabolic regulation. As you eat, foods are broken down and metabolized. But the energy stored in the food’s chemical bonds cannot be destroyed. Simply put, if more calories are consumed than are required for growth, activity, and maintenance, the excess energy is stored within the body. This energy is stored when enzymes catalyze the formation of new chemical bonds to create specific kinds of macromolecules (i.e., glycogen, fat, and protein), which tends to increase overall body mass. On the other hand, if not enough food calories are consumed, the body will begin to break down its own tissues as a source of energy, and will decline in mass as a result. Note that when “calories” are being discussed in reference to food consumption, the word "calorie" actually refers to a kilocalorie. One kilocalorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. It is the unit typically used when discussing human nutrition and energy balance. For your reference, a typical adult male requires about 2,500 calories per day; a female of average size might require 2,000 calories daily. The body’s calorie requirement declines with age, and depends on many factors, including body size, sex, and physical activity. Calories and Weight A pound of body fat stores a total of about 3,500 calories. Use the calculator below to answer the following questions. In the entry boxes, enter calorie surpluses or deficits. A calorie surplus occurs when more calories are taken in than the body expends. A calorie deficit results when more calories are expended through maintenance and activity than are obtained from food. As you have seen, the balance between caloric intake and output must be held within narrow limits to maintain a steady body weight. Yet some humans do this without conscious effort. How does this remarkable balancing act work? First, consider what happens over the course of a typical day. After a meal, extra calories are initially stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a complex carbohydrate). Glycogen is broken down and used to supply glucose for intense exercise, and to provide glucose while we sleep. Breakfast provides fuel to rebuild some of the body’s glycogen stores that were depleted overnight. Thus, over short time scales, glycogen storage is an efficient way to provide glucose when it’s needed between meals. Over longer time periods, body fat is used to store excess energy. When glycogen stores are full, the body switches over to storing the excess energy as fat. Remember that energy is stored within chemical bonds, and so it is the chemical bonds within glycogen and fat molecules that contain energy. Fat is an efficient way for the body to store extra calories, because it is able to pack more calories per unit mass when compared with carbohydrates or proteins (see Figure 8.2 below). You can think of body fat as a long-term, highly compacted energy reserve. Fat Stores Maximum Energy per Unit of Mass At 9 kilocalories per gram, fat stores more than twice as much energy per unit mass than proteins or carbohydrates. Regulation and Human Health How are caloric intake and energy output balanced? Your levels of hunger and overall metabolic rate change in response to your nutritional status. When your stomach is empty, a hormone called ghrelin is secreted. This acts on receptors in the brain to stimulate feelings of hunger. When the stomach is full, ghrelin secretion stops and so do your cravings for food. If a person takes in less calories than required for maintenance and activity, glycogen reserves are broken down first. This leads to rapid weight loss early on, because each gram of glycogen associates with up to four grams of water. As glycogen is broken down, water is released in urine. Most of the initial weight loss is actually “water weight.” Later weight loss comes more slowly, because body fat stores a great deal of energy and is associated with much less water. Importantly, body fat is not just a storage bin. It also has a role as an endocrine (hormone-secreting) organ. For example, body fat secretes a hormone called leptin. This acts on target cells in the brain to produce feelings of “fullness.” Loss of body fat leads to decreases in leptin and increasing feelings of hunger. Second, loss of weight also has effects on a person’s energy output. As a person loses weight, total metabolism goes down simply because the body is getting smaller. More significantly, the per-pound rate of metabolism is turned down to conserve energy and resist what the body perceives as “starvation.” A person in this state will feel sluggish and reluctant to exercise. Taken together, these and other mechanisms tend to automatically adjust our hunger and activity to maintain our weight. When Regulation Goes Haywire: Obesity Obesity is a condition in which body fat is excessive and interferes with normal function or impairs health. Obesity can make many physical activities difficult or impossible. It is associated with many increased health risks; type II diabetes (see below), hypertension, and heart disease are three serious conditions that are clearly more common among obese people than their normal-weight peers. Obese people also suffer socially and professionally because of weight-related bias and discrimination. Why don’t the normal regulatory mechanisms work to limit weight in people who become obese? This is a question that has fueled considerable research and debate. Findings suggest that there are many contributing factors. For example, many (but not all) obese individuals have very high circulating levels of leptin in keeping with their high body fat reserves. Yet the target cells in their brains do not respond to leptin in the normal way; they do not perceive satisfaction or fullness. Obesity may result from a mismatch between our evolutionary adaptations and the realities of the modern world. We expend less calories each day on physical tasks than did previous generations of humans. More than 100 years ago, the average person may have expended 30 percent to 50 percent more calories each day than a typical modern American. In addition, today we have continuous access to an unprecedented array of calorie-rich foods. In times past, when food was scarce and could not be preserved easily, it was adaptive to feast on rich foods when they were available. Those who did so could build up fat and glycogen reserves, and thus were more likely to survive famines. Today, in a changed environment, the same behaviors predispose us to obesity. Solutions to Obesity? Our society’s main effort to overcome obesity has come in the form of dieting. Diet fads constantly come and go — Atkins, South Beach, Acai Berry, the Hollywood diet, and pills, drinks, or even machines that purportedly melt away fat. In fact, the total sales of weight loss services and products were estimated at over $55 billion in 2009. Unfortunately, all of this effort and expense does not appear to do much good. Surveys, clinical trials, and literature reviews have repeatedly turned up a depressing pattern: about 80 percent of dieters regain lost weight within one to five years — and very often shoot past their prediet weight with each cycle. If crash dieting is a bad idea, and we are “hardwired” to overeat, is there any hope for solving the obesity problem? Yes, there are many efforts in this direction. Medical approaches: For the extremely obese, surgical options that reduce the size of the stomach are often effective. These procedures may work partly by reducing the stomach’s output of ghrelin, thus reducing the hunger pangs associated with an empty stomach. Some drugs also show promise. Behavior change: Much research is now exploring how different practices — emotional support groups, healthy cooking classes, and more — can help obese people make small, sustainable changes to their lifestyles for weight control and better health. Societal change: Many are trying to reduce obesity by building parks and bike lanes, taxing snack foods and sugary sodas, changing school lunch menus, expanding physical education classes, posting calorie counts in restaurants, and much more. These efforts are meant to change the overall social and physical environment to encourage more physical activity and less intake of calorie-rich foods.

Application Spotlight: Progeria Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, HGPS) Child with progeria. HGPS is a childhood disorder caused by mutations in one of the major architectural proteins of the cell nucleus. In HGPS patients, the cell nucleus has dramatically aberrant morphology (bottom, right) rather than the uniform shape typically found in healthy individuals (top, right). By P Scaffidi (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome) CC BY 2.5 HGPS is an extremely rare (one case per eight million live births) autosomal dominant disorder characterized by accelerated aging. The disorder is caused in the gene coding for lamin A, a protein involved in chromosome organization. The defective protein accumulates in the nuclear membrane of the cells, affecting many cellular processes. Symptoms start before age two, with thinning skin and weak muscles and bones. Aging is estimated to be eight to 10 times faster than normal. Patients die in their teens from stroke or heart attack. How do people “get” progeria? It is important to remember that because progeria patients die at a very young age, progeria is not inherited, but only appears as a random mutation. This explains its fortunately very low incidence.   Human Organ Systems: Review and Assessment An organ system is an integrated collection of organs in the body that work together to perform a vital function. Major organ systems in the body include: Digestive System Respiratory System Cardiovascular System Lymphatic System Urinary System Integumentary System Skeletal System Muscular System Nervous System Endocrine System In this module, we investigated the function and organs that make up the Respiratory System, Cardiovascular System, Skeletal System, Muscular System, and the Nervous System.   Organ Systems for Vital Functions In this section, you will learn about the organ systems that are necessary for the vital functions of life in humans. The organ systems of the body will be systematically described, as well as, the major anatomical structures and functions. Organ System An organ system is an integrated collection of organs in the body that work together to perform a vital function. This course will organize the organ systems of the body based on the vital functions defined earlier. The major organ systems of the body are shown in the table below. Major Organ Systems of the Body Grouped by Primary Function Function Organ System Exchange with the Environment Digestive System Respiratory System Fluid Transport within the Body Cardiovascular System Lymphatic System and Immunity Urinary System Structure, Support, Protection and Movement Integumentary System Skeletal System Muscular System Control and Regulation Nervous System Endocrine System Skeletal System As an example of how the components of an organ system work together, let’s look at the skeletal system. The most obvious components of this system are the bones, which form a rigid framework for the body. The bones contribute to our ability to stand upright and move around, but they can’t do it alone. Ligaments and cartilage are also parts of the skeletal system. Ligaments connect the bones to each other. Cartilage cushions the spaces between the bones, allowing for smooth movement. And the bones couldn’t move at all without the skeletal muscles, and tendons that connect muscles to bones (parts of the muscular system). The bones provide the muscles with something to pull against. If one component of an organ system is damaged or malfunctions, the function of the organ system will be affected. Think about a broken bone. If the femur breaks, it will be much harder to maintain an upright posture, or to walk or run. These might also be more difficult if the cartilage of the femur is destroyed by arthritis or a ligament in the knee is injured while playing a sport. If any component of the skeletal system is damaged—bone, ligament or cartilage—the knee will not function properly. The sections that follow will describe the details of the some of these essential organ systems that perform vital functions of human life. You will learn how they contribute to homeostasis and how imbalances in homeostasis lead to various disease states.   Exchanging Nutrients and Waste With the Environment Every cell needs to take in nutrients and get rid of waste products. This is accomplished via processes that exchange molecules across the cell membrane. For a single-celled organism, this is accomplished through direct exchange with the environment. It gets more complicated with larger organisms where cells are not in direct contact with the “outside” environment. In such organisms, including humans, there are specialized organ systems that serve as interfaces with the environment, moving things into, and out of, the body to keep it functioning. The two major organ systems that serve to exchange nutrients and waste with the environment are the digestive system (food and feces) and respiratory system (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Humans take in food, water and oxygen. During digestion and metabolism, food is broken down into simpler substances (including some waste products), and some of those simpler substances—for example, simple sugars—can be metabolized in a way that they release energy, especially when oxygen is present. The products of these processes include solid waste, liquid waste, and carbon dioxide. These waste materials must be eliminated from the body to prevent illness. The urinary system also helps with removal of wastes being transported in the body fluids, but the “exchange” is all internal so it will be explored more in next the vital function category.   Respiratory System Respiratory System - Function When humans breathe, air enters and exits via the respiratory system. This allows the body to obtain oxygen, which is needed for metabolic processes, and eliminate carbon dioxide, which is a metabolic waste product and can affect the body's pH homeostasis. Like the digestive system, the respiratory system can be thought of as a tube, or rather, as a branching series of tubes that get smaller and smaller as they branch off. Unlike the digestive system, which moves solids and liquids in a single direction, the respiratory system moves gases in both directions, when we inhale and exhale. When we inhale, air passes through the nose or mouth into the pharynx, larynx , trachea , lungs, and into smaller and smaller airways termed bronchi and then bronchioles, until it reaches the air sacs, or alveoli . Only a single cell thick, the walls of the alveoli allow the oxygen in air to diffuse into the blood, and the cardiovascular system carries it to each cell in the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, also diffuses through the alveolar walls, but in the opposite direction, from the blood to the airways. Carbon dioxide is then exhaled through the airways to the external environment. Respiratory System - Organs The organs of the respiratory system are arranged in a roughly superior to inferior direction and include: Nose Mouth Pharynx Larynx Trachea Lungs Within the lungs, the respiratory system can be further divided into: Bronchi (singular bronchus) Bronchiole tree Alveoli (singular alveolus) Note that the pharynx (the part of the throat just behind the mouth) is listed as a part of both the digestive and respiratory systems. Food and beverages pass through the pharynx on the way through the digestive tract. Air passes through the pharynx on its way to and from the lungs. Food and water are prevented from entering the airway when we swallow by a structure called the epiglottis. It is not uncommon for organs to be part of more than one organ system. The pancreas, for example, has both digestive and endocrine functions, and the kidneys play a role in both the urinary and endocrine systems.

The pancreas, for example, has both digestive and endocrine functions, and the kidneys play a role in both the urinary and endocrine systems.   Fluid Transport Within the Body Our body constantly transports molecules from one place to another to carry out the required metabolic functions for daily living. As we take in nutrients and oxygen, these molecules must be delivered to the cells, tissues, and organs that need them for metabolic processes. Furthermore, our body must have a system for disposing of wastes generated by metabolism and foreign particles, which may potentially disturb optimal body function. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems coordinate a diverse set of transport functions. The cardiovascular system consists of the blood, heart, and blood vessels. The heart supplies the force to circulate blood throughout the body via the blood vessels. Blood is the main fluid used to deliver nutrients to the body’s tissues and to receive wastes that will ultimately be removed from the body by the urinary system. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems work together to take oxygen in from the external environment and deliver it, via blood, to cells. In a similar fashion, these systems also use the blood to remove carbon dioxide from cells and release it into the external environment. The red blood cells or erythrocytes are responsible for the transport of respiratory gasses. The lymphatic system consists of lymphatic vessels which are near blood vessels and several organs such as lymph nodes, the thymus gland, and spleen. It returns excess tissue fluid to the cardiovascular system while initiating immune responses to ensure that the delivered blood is not compromised, responding to foreign invasion in multiple ways. The lymphatic system is an integrated part of the immune system to cleanse body fluids of dead cells, toxins, and pathogens. Together, the transport systems of the body coordinate the efforts of nutrient delivery and removal of wastes and other harmful substances. In addition to transporting the fluid, fluid/electrolyte balance must be maintained by integrated function of these organ systems: urinary, lymphatic and cardiovascular.   Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular System - Function The cardiovascular system transports, from one part of the body to another: nutrients, oxygen, ions, proteins, hormones and other signaling molecules, as well as waste products, including carbon dioxide. This system also helps to maintain homeostasis of fluid volume, pH, and temperature. Cardiovascular System - Organs The primary components of the cardiovascular system are blood, the heart, and the vessels of the circulatory system, which work together to transport nutrients, wastes, and gases to every cell in the body. The blood that is circulated throughout the body contains two main components: Plasma contains water, electrolytes, glucose, proteins (including enzymes, hormones, and blood clotting factors) and metabolic wastes Formed elements or blood cells There are three types of formed elements: Red blood cells transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. White blood cells fight infection by attacking foreign cells, and clear old or diseased cells. Platelets are important for hemostasis (not to be confused with homeostasis); hemostasis is our ability to stop bleeding after vascular injury (injury to blood vessels). The blood functions to transport molecules and blood cells and contributes to the maintenance of pH balance. Blood cells are formed in the red bone marrow. The heart is divided into four chambers. The two lower chambers, called ventricles, force blood out into the arteries. The two upper chambers of the heart, called atria, receive blood returning from the veins. The heart contracts as a unit, both atria (named right and left) contract together to move blood into the ventricles and then both ventricles contract at the same time to move blood out of the heart into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiovascular system is divided into two functional subsystems. The systemic circuit transports blood and its components to the body. The pulmonary circuit transports blood and its components between the heart and the lungs. Arteries of the systemic circuit (also known as the systemic circulatory circuit) carry oxygenated blood from your heart to provide oxygen and nutrients dissolved in the blood to every cell in your body. When blood leaves the left ventricle it first enters the aorta, the largest artery in the human body. Arteries gradually branch into smaller and more numerous arterioles which then supply blood to the smallest vessels, termed capillaries. It is estimated that your body contains approximately 60,000 miles of capillaries, that is enough to encircle earth three times! Capillaries allow the exchange of oxygen, nutrients and waste between the blood and tissue cells. After waste has been picked up, blood is moved through vessels of increasing size venules into the larger veins. Veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart, where the blood is passed to the pulmonary circuit to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The pulmonary artery (part of the pulmonary circuit) carries oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart. Without this system in place that involves both the pumping of the heart to squeeze blood out, and the network of vessels to distribute the pumped blood, the cells of your body would not have an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen. The cardiovascular system transports, from one part of the body to another: nutrients, oxygen, ions, proteins, hormones and other signaling molecules, as well as waste products, including carbon dioxide. This system also helps to maintain homeostasis of fluid volume, pH, and temperature.

Structure, Support, Protection and Movement Previous sections contained an overview of some of the inputs and outputs necessary for life as well as a mechanism to deliver them within the body. This section will discuss the structures the human body needs to compartmentalize and protect these vital components; and, the structures that enable the body to move, obtain nutrients, and avoid predators. Organ systems are required to coordinate these many efforts. Maintenance of a consistent physical structure is important for the body to function efficiently. Support and structure are among the primary functions of the integumentary system, the skeletal , system and the muscular system. These organ systems also allow the body to move in response to internal and external stimuli.   Skeletal System Skeletal System - Function The skeletal system, which includes the skeleton and articulations (joints), provides support and protection for soft tissues and organs, aids in movement, serves as a reservoir of calcium, and produces all blood cells. Although we often think of bones as the only organs of the skeletal system, cartilage, ligaments and tendons are equally important organs. These structures of the skeletal system work together to: provide leverage and resist forces from muscles and gravity. keep joints together. allow flexibility within joints. maintain a safe range of motion. Bones are found throughout the body from the skull in the head to the 26 bones in the foot. Bones allow us to maintain our stature, they protect softer internal organs, and they let us move around. Bones are interconnected by articulations, another word for joints. In an articulation, where bone meets bone, there is a layer of softer cartilage. Articulations are then stabilized by ligaments, which help keep the bones aligned properly. Bones are connected to the muscular system by tendons, which allow the body to move. Skeletal System - Organs The major structures within the skeletal system are: bones cartilage ligaments tendons The skeletal system consists of bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. Bone is the primary organ of the skeletal system. Although there are different types of bones in our body, the basic components of all bone tissue are the same: Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, which are specialized cells that are responsible for bone formation, regulation and repair. Collagens and other proteins, which give bone its flexibility. Inorganic calcium and phosphate minerals, which give bone its hardness. Red bone marrow, which produces all blood cells in a process termed hematopoiesis (or hemopoiesis). These basic components give bone tissue its load-bearing, protective qualities. The living cells in bone allow it to sense and respond to stress. The inorganic matrix of bone gives the bone rigidity and also acts as a storage depot for calcium and phosphorus in the body. Cartilage is a firm, flexible, and smooth connective tissue found at the ends of bones. Cartilage is present in joints to protect the bone and to evenly distribute forces to the underlying bone. Ligaments are band-like elastic structures that surround joints to hold them together. Ligaments connect one bone to another bone, and allow movement in very specific directions. Tendons are band-like structures similar to ligaments. However, tendons are more rigid and connect bones to muscles. Tendons play a role in integrating the force generation of the muscle with the rigid bone, which helps actuate large-scale motion. The numerous organs and structures of the skeletal system allow it to serve an important role in the support and protection of our body. Bones are very strong, yet flexible which makes them perfect for supporting our weight and allowing movement. The connective tissues such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons aid in protecting our joints and providing stability. The red bone marrow inside the bone is vital for hematopoiesis or the production of all blood cells. Bones are also a reservoir for calcium. If your diet is deficient in calcium, a hormone will mobilize calcium from the bones to the blood, and your bones will be weaker. The skeletal system, which includes the skeleton and articulations (joints), provides support and protection for soft tissues and organs, aids in movement, serves as a reservoir of calcium, and produces all blood cells.

Collagens and other proteins, which give bone its flexibility. Inorganic calcium and phosphate minerals, which give bone its hardness. Red bone marrow, which produces all blood cells in a process termed hematopoiesis (or hemopoiesis). These basic components give bone tissue its load-bearing, protective qualities. The living cells in bone allow it to sense and respond to stress. The inorganic matrix of bone gives the bone rigidity and also acts as a storage depot for calcium and phosphorus in the body. Cartilage is a firm, flexible, and smooth connective tissue found at the ends of bones. Cartilage is present in joints to protect the bone and to evenly distribute forces to the underlying bone. Ligaments are band-like elastic structures that surround joints to hold them together. Ligaments connect one bone to another bone, and allow movement in very specific directions. Tendons are band-like structures similar to ligaments. However, tendons are more rigid and connect bones to muscles. Tendons play a role in integrating the force generation of the muscle with the rigid bone, which helps actuate large-scale motion. The numerous organs and structures of the skeletal system allow it to serve an important role in the support and protection of our body. Bones are very strong, yet flexible which makes them perfect for supporting our weight and allowing movement. The connective tissues such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons aid in protecting our joints and providing stability. The red bone marrow inside the bone is vital for hematopoiesis or the production of all blood cells. Bones are also a reservoir for calcium. If your diet is deficient in calcium, a hormone will mobilize calcium from the bones to the blood, and your bones will be weaker.   Muscular System Muscular System - Function The muscular (musculoskeletal) system generates force for movement of bones around articulations, facial expression, breathing, posture, and assists with temperature regulation. The muscular system only contains skeletal muscle, although the body also has smooth and cardiac muscle tissue, which are important in other body systems. There are over 650 skeletal muscles in the human body! The skeletal muscle converts signals from the nervous system into movement via muscle contractions. Muscles, like the biceps and triceps, are the organs of the skeletal muscular system. The main functions of skeletal muscles include: responding to neural information (conscious control) applying forces to the bones to cause movement producing heat to warm the body changing the size of the thoracic cavity for breathing applying forces for conscious control of openings to the outside of the body (sphincters) The muscular system contains muscle tissues and interconnects with both the nervous system and skeletal system. Nerves control the muscles and allow us to consciously direct movements. Some muscles, such as the muscles that control the pupil of your eye, cannot be controlled consciously but react to nerve stimuli. The skeletal system provides a stiff support for muscles to pull on. Muscles generate force to lift as well as to balance us. The energy produced by contracting muscles (such as when shivering) in the muscle system helps keep us warm. There are many muscle fiber types throughout the body that vary based on function. Parallel muscles form along the long bones, pennate and convergent muscle fibers attach to tendons and circular muscles assist with closing our eyes or puckering our lips. Muscular System - Organs The major structures within the muscular system are: skeletal muscles tendons Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that attach to, and contract to move the bones. Skeletal muscles often work in pairs. When one muscle is contracting, the other is relaxing. For example, to bend your arm at the elbow, your biceps muscle contracts, and your triceps muscle relaxes. To straighten your arm, the biceps relaxes, and the triceps contracts. The diaphragm is skeletal muscle that contracts and relaxes for inhalation and exhalation. Hiccups are a spasm in your diaphragm muscle. Skeletal muscles are made of long cylinder shaped cells called muscle fibers, which have many nuclei within each cell. Therefore we say that skeletal muscle is multi-nucleate. The functional unit within a skeletal muscle fiber, called a sarcomere (note that “sarc” means flesh), contains filaments of the proteins actin and myosin. Myosin is a thicker protein (appears darker) than actin and the two proteins create a pattern so the muscle appears striped or striated. Notice the appearance of skeletal muscle in this transmission electron microscope view. Sarcomere - By Louisa Howard Human skeletal muscle tissue 1). Public Domain. A muscle contraction occurs when the myosin filaments pull on the actin to shorten the sarcomere. This results in shortening of the muscle fiber and ultimately the entire muscle shortens or contracts to pull on the bone. An electrical signal from the nervous system is necessary to cause a skeletal muscle contraction. The area where the nerve meets the muscle to stimulate it is termed neuromuscular junction. When a nerve signal reaches the neuromuscular junction, the muscle fiber is stimulated and the muscle contracts. In the image below the #1 is termed the axon or the part of a neuron that carries the instructions from the brain and spinal cord. #2 is the end of the axon called the axon terminal or synaptic vesicle. #3 is the muscle and #4 is a group or bundle of muscle fibers. Neuromuscular Junction: axon, synaptical junction, muscle fiber, and myofibrils. Drawn by Utilisateur:Dake; derivative work by Marek M) CC-BY-SA-3.0 Tendons are grouped in both the skeletal system and the muscular system since they connect the two systems (connect muscle to bone). Tendons play a role in transmitting force from the muscles to the bones to permit movement. Other Muscle Types Although only skeletal muscle is part of the muscular system, there are three types of muscle tissue. Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle are similar to skeletal muscle, but perform specialized functions in the body. Most of these functions are involuntary and do not include the skeletal system. Smooth muscles control involuntary functions of the body, such as arterial contractions to move blood and peristaltic contractions in the digestive system to move food. Smooth muscles lack striations thus, are termed smooth due to their appearance. They are composed of muscle fibers with a single nucleus in each cell and are uninucleate. Smooth muscles do not have any attachment to the skeletal system. Smooth muscle has the ability to produce its own contractions involuntarily. However, as with skeletal muscle, electrical signals from the nervous system can modulate the activities of smooth muscle. The organization of smooth muscle on a cellular level is irregular and unorganized. Therefore, smooth muscle does not contain sarcomeres. Cardiac muscle contains similarities to both skeletal and smooth muscle. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is composed of organized muscle fibers and sarcomeres, and is striated. However, cardiac muscle does not attach to the skeletal system and is under involuntary control, and is uninucleate. Cardiac muscle is not long and cylinder shaped like skeletal muscle but is more branched. The muscular (musculoskeletal) system generates force for movement of bones around articulations, facial expression, breathing, posture, and assists with temperature regulation.

Control and Regulation The nervous and endocrine systems work together to control many of the body’s other organ systems through electrical signals and chemical messengers. The systems integrate with each other, so that control systems within the nervous system regulate many activities of the endocrine system and hormones of the endocrine system can affect some of the functions of the nervous system. The chemical messengers produced by each individual system are responsible for many homeostatic functions, through feedback mechanisms. The activities of the two systems coordinate many of the body’s metabolic activities.   Nervous System Nervous System - Function The basic functional units of the nervous system that transmit messages are cells called neurons. Signals travel through a neuron as electrical impulses. Neurons release chemical substances, known as neurotransmitters, to transmit information to other neurons, to muscles, or to glands. The chemical messages of the nervous system are transmitted over short distances, and their effects are short-lived. The nervous system allows for control and coordination of skeletal muscular movements that may be consciously predetermined, or may happen automatically, such as reflexes. Other parts of the nervous system control and coordinate subconscious body activities, including heart rate, gland secretions and smooth muscle movement in the digestive system. Some activities, such as breathing, can be controlled both subconsciously and consciously. The nervous system typically works quickly. It also allows us to integrate and store information, such as when you are learning. The nervous system transmits signals to different parts of the body to coordinate function. Electrochemical signals are processed in the brain and sent down the spinal cord, which runs the length of the back. From the spinal cord, peripheral nerves send signals out to the extremities. Return signals come in through sensory nerves and either return to the spinal cord for processing or back to the brain. The spinal cord processes reflexes and repeated patterns. Nervous System - Organs and Structures The nervous system is often divided into two functional parts: The central nervous system, which processes incoming information and initiates a response. The peripheral nervous system, which brings sensory information to, or carries motor output from, the central nervous system to initiate a reaction. Central Nervous System The major structures within the central nervous system are: brain spinal cord The brain has several lobes, each of which carries out specific functions and processes information associated with specific parts of the body. The spinal cord is located within the vertebral column and processes some reflexes but primarily transmits information to and from the brain along neurons. Specialized membranes called meninges cover the brain and the spinal cord to protect them. Additionally, a special fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, chemically and mechanically protects the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral Nervous System The major structures within the peripheral nervous system are: cranial nerves spinal nerves The peripheral nervous system is composed of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Nerves are bundles of extensions from neurons that extend through the body in the peripheral nervous system. These nerves are categorized into the following functional groups: sensory nerves, which carry sensory input to the brain or spinal cord from the environment. motor nerves, which carry motor impulses from the brain or spinal cord to muscles or glands. mixed nerves, which have a combination of sensory and motor neurons in one nerve. The peripheral nervous system can be subdivided into two subdivisions: the somatic and autonomic divisions. The somatic nervous system includes sensory neurons that send sensory information from sensory receptors of the skeletal muscle, skin and special senses (including smell, taste, sight, hearing and equilibrium) to the central nervous system and motor neurons that control skeletal muscle. The autonomic nervous system monitors and regulates changes in the body's internal environment. These changes are not under voluntary control. Body processes controlled by the autonomic nervous system include the contractions of the stomach and other digestive organs, the heart rate, and contractions of blood vessels to control blood pressure and flow though the body. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The sympathetic nervous system controls functions that speed up the heart and increase energy usage during emergencies or times of stress. On the other hand, the parasympathetic nervous system controls functions that have the opposite effect—they reduce heart rate and decrease overall energy usage when the body is returning to normal after an emergency or during normal functioning. The basic functional units of the nervous system that transmit messages are cells called neurons. Signals travel through a neuron as electrical impulses. Neurons release chemical substances, known as neurotransmitters, to transmit information to other neurons, to muscles, or to glands. The chemical messages of the nervous system are transmitted over short distances, and their effects are short-lived.

Vital Functions for Human Life In this unit, you will be introduced to the major organ systems of the body. To put these systems in context, we will first discuss vital functions of life. Within any organism, there are a multitude of functions taking place at any given time. Humans, for example, can breathe, talk, digest food, process visual images, and move their bodies all at the same time. While all of these activities are important, some are essential to the survival of the human body itself. They are vital functions Our body's anatomy and physiology works together to perform the vital functions that keep us alive - processes or actions of the body on which life is directly dependent. You will examine four main vital functions in this course: exchange with the environment; transport within the body; structure, support, and movement; and control and regulation. For human life, there are several vital functions. So you now know that all multicellular organisms need to do the following in order to survive: Exchange with the environment Transport fluids and material throughout the body Provide structure, support, protection and movement Regulate and control processes So what does this mean? What does this involve? How does the human body do these things? Try answering the questions below to begin broadly thinking about bodily function within these categories and how they are linked to one or more of the primary organ systems. Exchange with the Environment An organism constantly interacts with its environment. In order to survive, the human body must obtain food, water, and oxygen from the world around it. The human body must also rid itself of wastes before they build up to toxic levels. Two organ systems are primarily responsible for exchange of material with the environment. The digestive system brings food and water into the body and eliminates solid wastes. The respiratory system brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The urinary system doesn’t take in anything from the environment, but does eliminate waste products of metabolism from the body fluid. However, this is just one of several roles that the urinary system plays in maintaining homeostasis of body fluids, so it will be explored more extensively in the next vital function category involving body fluids. Fluid Transport within the Body Single-celled organisms can absorb nutrients and oxygen directly from the environment into the cells, where they are used to support basic cell functions. Waste products are excreted from these single cells in a similar fashion. In multi-celled organisms like humans, however, most cells are not exposed directly to the outside environment. Instead, body cells rely on organ systems to transport and regulate the composition of internal fluids throughout the body. Three main body systems, the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system, and the urinary system take care of this vital bodily function. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems also participate in the function of immunity, to help defend the body's cells from foreign organisms that may enter the body tissues or fluids. The lymphatic system returns interstitial fluid to blood and the urinary system filters blood to regulate body fluid homeostasis, including volume, pressure, and chemical composition. Structure, Support, Protection, and Movement For the organs of the human body to function, they must be protected from potentially damaging substances in the environment. One level of defense is provided by the integumentary system, made up of the skin, hair, and nails. This system prevents many potentially harmful irritants from entering the body. Eyelashes, for example, help keep sand or other items out of the eyes, where they could potentially cause serious damage, and the skin prevents most pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) from entering the body and destroying healthy body cells. Certain parts of the skeletal system, such as the skull and ribcage, also help to protect the internal organs, such as the brain, heart and lungs, from damage. The skeletal system and the muscular system also support the body and allow it to move away from danger, toward food sources, etc. The cardiovascular and lymphatic systems also help defend the body’s cells from foreign organisms that may enter the body tissues or fluids through the process of immunity. Control and Regulation To keep itself in a state of equilibrium, an organism must constantly gather information and react accordingly. In humans, the nervous system, made up of the brain, nerves, spinal cord and sensory organs, reacts to stimuli in the environment and signals other systems when actions are needed to bring the body back into balance. The endocrine system, which produces hormones and other regulatory substances, plays a key role in maintaining balance among chemical messengers within the body. Locally, most body cells can produce chemical messages that influence the metabolism of other cells. And there are some organs in other body systems that produce chemicals that can travel through the body to regulate metabolic processes in other organs. As you can see, several organ systems work together to accomplish these various vital functions throughout the body. Since the organ systems are distributed throughout large regions of the human body, it is necessary to define orientation within the body and communicate the proper terminology as you study these integrated structures and functions.
