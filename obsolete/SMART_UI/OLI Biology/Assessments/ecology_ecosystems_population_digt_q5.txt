Excess nutrients from farms and cities enter the Mississippi River and flow out into the Gulf of Mexico.  The extra nutrients support a bloom of algae.  Algae and decomposers remove oxygen from the water when they respire.  Fish, mollusks, and crustaceans either die or move out of the area where oxygen levels are depleted.
