In dogs, colored fur (E) is dominant to un-colored fur (e). Black fur color (B) is
                dominant to brown fur color (b). The E gene is epistatic to the B gene. A brown male
                dog is mated to a black female. Both the male and female are homozygous at all loci.
                What percentage of the puppies will be black?
