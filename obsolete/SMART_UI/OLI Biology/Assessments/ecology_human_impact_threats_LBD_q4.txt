Various species of
                staghorn and elkhorn coral (Acropora sp.) are now threatened or endangered. These
                corals help create tropical and subtropical coral reefs. The corals are threatened
                by a phenomenon known as coral bleaching, which occurs in response to excessively
                warm water temperatures. Evidence indicates that this is a result of global climate
                change, which in turn is a result of greenhouse gases that pollute the atmosphere.
                Excess carbon dioxide also directly affects the pH of seawater, causing problems for
                corals. Rivers carry excess nutrients, organic matter, and sediments from cities and
                agricultural areas and dump them into the sea. Corals are often smothered by
                sediment or killed by algal growth in these areas. Finally, in some places corals
                suffer because top predator fish are overharvested. As a result, smaller animals
                that prey on corals become abundant and damage the reefs.
