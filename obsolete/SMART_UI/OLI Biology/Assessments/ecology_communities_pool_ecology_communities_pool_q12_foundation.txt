In Africa, grasses are the main vegetation in savanna communities. Acacias and other
            trees are few and widely scattered. Elephants range over very large territories and are
            not very abundant in any one location. However, they strongly affect the community by
            uprooting and consuming trees and shrubs, maintaining suitable habitat for grasses and
            grassland animals. Many species of birds and insects live in the savanna grasses. Which
            of the species or groups above would best be described as foundation species?
