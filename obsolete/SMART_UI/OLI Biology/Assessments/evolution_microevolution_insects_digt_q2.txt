There are several antimalarial drugs available today. Some of them are taken prior
                to human exposure to the parasite and act as a preventative medications while other
                drugs are administered only after a person is infected with the malarial parasite
                and act as malaria therapeutics. Which of the following is NOT a way in which
                evolution could lead to decreased drug effectiveness?
