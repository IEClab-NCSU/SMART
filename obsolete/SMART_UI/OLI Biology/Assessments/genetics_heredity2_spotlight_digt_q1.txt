Two identical twins (female) live in different parts of the country. One is very committed
				to a healthy lifestyle: not smoking, exercising regularly, eating a diet rich in
				fresh produce, and avoiding red meats and processed foods. The other is not as
				careful: she smokes, is overweight, and often eats fast and processed foods. They
				are aware that several women in their family have had breast cancer, and decide to
				consult a doctor about their odds of developing the disease. Which of the following
				statements by the doctor sounds most correct?
