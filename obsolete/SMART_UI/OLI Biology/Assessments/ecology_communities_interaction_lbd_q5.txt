“Cookies” cut from the trunks of two different longleaf pine trees, both in
                    Alabama, southeastern USA. The age and growth rate of the trees can be
                    determined by counting their annual growth rings and measuring the spacing
                    between them. Image by David Stephens (longleaf pine) CC BY 3.0
                Which “cookie” do you think was cut from the older tree?
