Occasionally American alligators are sighted in rivers or lakes in New York City, far
            north of their usual range. These alligators are usually escaped pets. There is no
            self-sustaining population of alligators in New York, and they have no important
                influence on other populations there. Is the American alligator a member of the
                ecological community in New York?
