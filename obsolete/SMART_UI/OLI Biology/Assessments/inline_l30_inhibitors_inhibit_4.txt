Now explore what happens at the high end
                of substrate concentrations.
Select [S]=20 and mentally note how frequently the enzymes have substrates bound and record the reaction velocity from the chart below.
<b>if you increased the substrate to 50, what would you predict for the rate of the reaction:<b>
