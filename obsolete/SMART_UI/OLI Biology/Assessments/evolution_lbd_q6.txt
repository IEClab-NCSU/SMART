Georges Cuvier, French scientist, demonstrated that some fossils represent life
                forms that are now extinct. Example: woolly mammoth, known from fossils but not from
                living specimens. Cuvier greatly advanced the study of fossil life and described
                many extinct species, including the pterodactyl.
