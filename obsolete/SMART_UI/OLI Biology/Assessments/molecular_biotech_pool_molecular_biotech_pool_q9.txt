The following is the DNA sequence of the expression plasmid adjacent to the
                ribosome binding site: -GAATTCGATATCAAGCTT
(EcoR1)(EcoRV) (HindIII)
You generated a synthetic gene for a human protein, but unfortunately you forgot
                    to include the recognition sequences for EcoR1 at the beginning and for HindIII
                    at the end of your synthetic gene, thus your gene looks like:
AGT------TAA
TCA------ATT
Given the following recognition sites: EcoR1 G^AATTC, EcoRV GAT^ATC, Hind III
                    A^AGCTT, can you still insert your synthetic gene into the expression
                    plasmid?
