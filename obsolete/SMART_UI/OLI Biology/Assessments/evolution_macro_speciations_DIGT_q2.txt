Lake Victoria in Africa is home to hundreds of colorful species of cichlids (small fish similar to sunfish) that are found nowhere else.  They all are closely related to each other.  Over the past several thousand years, Lake Victoria has existed as a continuous body of water; during the period when the fish species formed, there were no major droughts that would have divided the lake into smaller parts.  Taking all these facts into consideration, what is the likely mode of speciation for many (perhaps even all) of these cichlid species?
