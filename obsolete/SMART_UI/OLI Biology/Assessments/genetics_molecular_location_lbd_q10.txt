There is one more thing required by the DNA polymerase. It cannot just start making a
                DNA copy of the template strand; it needs a short piece of DNA or RNA with a free
                hydroxyl group in the right place to attach the nucleotides to (remember that
                synthesis always occurs in one direction — new building blocks are added to the 3’
                end). This component starts the process by giving DNA polymerase something to bind
                to. What might you call this short piece of nucleic acid?
