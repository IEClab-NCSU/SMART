In 2010, molecular biologist Craig Venter and his team announced that they had
				created a “synthetic cell.” Their procedure, very simply put, was to chemically
				synthesize the DNA of a known bacterium (very small) and introduce it into a
				bacterial cell that was modified to accept the new DNA. The synthetic DNA was
				translated into proteins, and the cells grew and divided. Do you consider this
				“creating life?” Why or why not?
