The following are estimates from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s International Database. They
            are averages for populations in two different groups of countries in 2012. 
Group A: Total fertility 1.6 births per woman over a lifetime, life
                    expectancy 78 years at birth, and population growth rate 0.3 % per year.
Group B: Total fertility 2.6 births per woman over a lifetime, life
                    expectancy 66 years at birth, and population growth rate 1.3 % per year.
 Which group do you think are the less developed countries, including most of
            Africa, Asia, and Latin America?
