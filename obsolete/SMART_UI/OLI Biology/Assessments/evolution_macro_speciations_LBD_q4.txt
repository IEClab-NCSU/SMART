Recently scientists have compared the genetics of several different mockingbird
                populations representing all four species throughout the Galapagos Islands. For
                example, they compared the genes of a population of N. parvulus on Baltra to those
                of all the other populations in their sample. Where do you think they found the
                closest match?
