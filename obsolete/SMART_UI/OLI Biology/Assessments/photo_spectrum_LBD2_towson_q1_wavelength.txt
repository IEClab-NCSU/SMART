According to the 2nd law of thermodynamics every transfer of energy results in
					the release of heat. Put another way, no transfer is 100% efficient. Every time
					energy is transferred from one form to another, some energy is lost as heat.
					Plant leaves often absorb more light energy than they are capable of using for
					photosynthesis at a given time. That excess energy is usually released from the
					pigments primarily as light via a process we call fluorescence. Assume the light
					absorbed by a plant leaf is yellow.
 
 If excess energy is released by fluorescence, what color would that light
					be?
