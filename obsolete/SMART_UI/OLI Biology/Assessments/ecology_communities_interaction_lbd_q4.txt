Both of these forests are dominated by a single tree species, longleaf pine
                    (Pinus palustris). Most trees in each forest are about the same age; the forests
                    were established when pine seeds sprouted after a fire or other land-clearing
                    event. On the left, forestry practices such as selective cutting and prescribed
                    fires have been used to remove many of the trees. On the right, trees have not
                    been removed by humans. Left image by Chuck Bargeron, USDA Forest Service (longleaf pine) CC BY 3.0 Right

 What kind of relationship do you think exists between the individual pine trees
                in each forest, and between the pine trees and the other plants growing beneath
                them?
