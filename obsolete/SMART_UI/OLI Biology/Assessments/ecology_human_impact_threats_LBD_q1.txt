The Carolina Parakeet is a parrot species that once was common in the eastern United
                States. It lived in old forests along rivers and nested in tree cavities. It was
                hunted for its colorful feathers and because farmers believed it to be a pest. Its
                forest habitats were cleared for farmland and its nest cavities were taken over by
                hives of honeybees, an introduced species. Carolina Parakeets may also have been
                harmed by an introduced disease acquired from domestic poultry. The last known wild
                Carolina Parakeet was killed in Florida in 1904 and the last captive specimen died
                in 1918.
