An osprey (Pandion haliaetus) captures a fish, which it
                    will consume or feed to its young. Studies indicate that predatory birds like
                    the osprey may reduce some fish populations. Furthermore, when osprey are
                    present small fish tend to select deeper water, spending less time close to the
                    waterâ€™s surface. By Craig O'Neal (Plucked!) CC BY 2.0 What is the relationship between osprey and
