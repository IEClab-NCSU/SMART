In this tree diagram, inheritance proceeds from left to right. Organisms at the
                    tips of the branches are living species and lines joining them show lines of
                    descent. At points where lines meet are common ancestors. After these points,
                    lines diverge as lineages evolve independently of each other.
Right now, we have only established that Salamander, Human, Mouse, and Sea Turtle
                    belong to a separate clade (called tetrapods, for “four feet”) that does not
                    include Carp.
What is the “Vertebrate Ancestor” on the left?
