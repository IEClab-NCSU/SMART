Look at the drawing below. The box is a “stock” - usually the body of an organism
				- containing stored chemical energy. The arrows represent “flows” of energy in and
				out. If energy flowing in is greater than energy flowing out, energy will accumulate
				in the box and the organism will grow. If energy flowing out is greater than intake,
				the organism will decline in size and perhaps die.

Which of the following would be
					correct for the "Energy In" box?
