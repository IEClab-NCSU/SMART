The amino acid asparagine is shown as a chemical drawing.
(Note that there are NO carbon atoms represented by a “C” drawn in this figure.
					However, you know that there is a carbon atom at every intersection that does
					not have a letter.)
One group of atoms is highlighted in yellow; the second group of atoms is
					highlighted in pink. Which group of highlighted atoms represents the atoms that
					are found in all amino acids?
