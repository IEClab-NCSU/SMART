Carolus Linnaeus, Swedish biologist, established a system for naming and
                classifying species based on similarities in their structure. Instead of being
                ranked in a continuous Chain of Being, organisms were clustered in natural groups.
                Linnaeus did not propose that species within a group were related by ancestry. Yet
                his system implied such relationships.
