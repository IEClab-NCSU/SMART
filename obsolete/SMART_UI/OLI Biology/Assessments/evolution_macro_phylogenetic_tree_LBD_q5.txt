Now we can split off the Sea Turtle, Human, and House Mouse and place them in
                    their own clade, the amniotes. The Salamander is a tetrapod, but it is not an
                    amniote: like the Carp, it lays soft gelatinous eggs with no amniotic membrane
                    around the embryo. This grouping can be shown as follows:

The tetrapod ancestor was an animal unlike anything that lives today. It was a
                    large fishlike animal whose stubby fins were partly modified to form grasping
                    limbs. Based on fossils that have been discovered and on genetic studies, the
                    first tetrapod lived over 400 million years ago. Based on the data we have
                in our Table, which grouping of species do you think will be supported next?
