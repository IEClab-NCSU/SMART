The covalent bonding of a phosphate to molecule X to form X-P is a
                        nonspontaneous process with a standard free energy (Go) change of
                        +10 kJ/mole. This reaction can be coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP with its
                        free energy change of -30 kJ/mole. The result is:
