The binding between an enzyme and substrate was originally thought to be a rigid
                    and precise interaction; this theory is called . It is now
                    known that enzymes and their substrate interact through a(n)  mechanism. In this mechanism upon binding the substrate the
                    enzyme undergoes a , this interaction helps to lower the
                     of the reaction.
