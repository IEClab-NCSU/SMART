In a grassland ecosystem, grasshoppers feed on grasses. Songbirds prey on the
                grasshoppers. The American kestrel, a small falcon also known as the sparrowhawk,
                feeds on the birds. Which of these populations do you think is the least abundant
                and requires the largest territory?
