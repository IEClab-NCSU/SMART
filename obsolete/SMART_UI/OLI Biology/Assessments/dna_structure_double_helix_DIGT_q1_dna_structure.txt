The two scientists credited with the discovery of DNA structure are  and . A key piece of data they used came
                    from the x-ray crystallography data produced by  working
                    in the lab of . This data showed that DNA has a  shape.
Some of the key features of the proposed DNA structure were:
1. The backbone of DNA strands is made up of alternating 
                    molecules, which are held together through  bonds.
2.  strands of DNA pair together through  bonds between  molecules.
3. The DNA strands are oriented  to each other.
4. In DNA adenine pairs with  through 
 bonds.
5. In DNA cytosine pairs with  through 
 bonds.
