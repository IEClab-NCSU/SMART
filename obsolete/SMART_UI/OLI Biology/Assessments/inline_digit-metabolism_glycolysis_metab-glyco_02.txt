A mutation occurs in the isomerase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
                        dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and
                        inactivates (inhibits) its activity. The resulting effect on glycolysis
                        is: __________________
