Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease associated with defects in
				the gene of an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. In
				homozygous recessive individuals, phenylalanine can accumulate to toxic levels over
				time, causing a variety of effects, from reduced skin and hair pigmentation to
				mental retardation. This disorder follows one of the non-Mendelian patterns reviewed
				in this module. Which pattern do you think it is?
