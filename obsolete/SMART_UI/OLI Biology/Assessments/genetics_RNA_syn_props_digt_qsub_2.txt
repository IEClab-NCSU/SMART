In eukaryotes, scientists often use a long strand of U nucleotides (poly U) bound
                to a surface to purify mRNA from all other nucleic acids in the cell. Why does this
                work? Put another way, what is the property of mRNA in eukaryotes that other nucleic
                acids lack?
