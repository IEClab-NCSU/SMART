The next three questions are based on the following information.
In humans, the ability to roll the tongue (T) is dominant over the inability to
                    do so (t). Suppose Mike, who can roll his tongue, and Jeannie, who cannot roll
                    her tongue, have a child, Benjamin.
Part 1 of 3: If Mikeâ€™s mother was able to roll her tongue but his father was not
                    able to roll his, then what is the probability that Benjamin will be able to
                    roll his tongue?
