Aphids and ants often have a close relationship as shown in this photo. The
                    greenish insects are aphids. They are sluggish, soft-bodied insects that use
                    piercing mouthparts to obtain sap (phloem) from plant hosts. To get the proteins
                    they need, aphids must process a lot of sugary sap. They excrete a sweet fluid
                    called honeydew as waste. Agile, quick ants swarm over the aphid colony,
                    drinking the honeydew. Ants often protect their aphid “herds” from predators and
                    may provide other services; for example they may move the flightless aphids from
                    plant to plant. Plants often suffer reduced survival and growth when infested
                    with aphids, particularly when aphids carry viral or bacterial diseases to their
                    hosts. By rowe_becky(flickr) ( Myrmica ruginodis and aphids) CC BY 2.0
