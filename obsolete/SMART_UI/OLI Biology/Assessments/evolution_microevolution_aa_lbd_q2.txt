You have already established that the fitness of aa homozygotes, those who suffer
                from sickle cell anemia, is very low. Such individuals usually do not reproduce
                under conditions of poor health care. If this is the case, how could the sickle cell
                allele persist in populations where malaria is highly prevalent? The answer involves
                natural selection.
