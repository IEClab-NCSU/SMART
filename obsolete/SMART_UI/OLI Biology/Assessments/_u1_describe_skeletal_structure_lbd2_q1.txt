The skeletal system consists of several structures. There are 206
                                     that form the majority of the system.
                              Articulations are formed at the junction of two bones. Each bone is
                              covered with a layer of  for cushioning
                              and shock absorption. The bones at the articulation are connected and
                              stabilized with  while  connect the muscle to the bone. Each bone
                              consists of cells termed , the protein
                                     which provides some flexibility
                              and the minerals  which
                              provide bone strength. The  is
                              essential as it functions for hematopoiesis.
