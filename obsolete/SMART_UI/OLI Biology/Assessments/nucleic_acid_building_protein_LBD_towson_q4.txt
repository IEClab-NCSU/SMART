Given the following information:
The triplet UAU codes for the amino acid tyrosine, or tyr
The triplet UCC codes for the amino acid serine, or ser
The triplet GGA codes for the amino acid glycine, gly

Assume this mRNA sequence is from the middle of a gene 5’ GGAUAUUCC 3’, what would be the amino acid sequence?
