Dandelion seeds have light wispy fruits, or “parachutes.” This feature increases
				the distance a seed can be carried on the wind. Seeds that land close to the parent
				plant are often at a disadvantage because of crowded conditions. Consider two
				dandelion types: one with fluffy parachutes and one with heavier, less fluffy
				parachutes. Which type of plant is likely to produce more offspring over a wider
				area?
