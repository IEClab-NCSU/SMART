Starting over, letâ€™s imagine that no fishing is allowed and the population grows
                nearly to its carrying capacity. Now that the fish are so abundant, managers decide
                to allow an annual harvest. What level of harvest could be sustained while keeping
                the population level constant at 90% of carrying capacity?
