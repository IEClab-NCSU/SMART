                    along tropical coasts. Mangrove trees grow in shallow salty or brackish (partly
                    fresh) water. The stilt-like roots form a tough interwoven mat. Photo by Anton

Mangrove forests like the one shown in the photo are common along sea coasts and
                    at river mouths in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Tough and complex,
                    they can withstand storm surges and tsunami waves without washing away. Organic
                    debris settles among the roots and gets buried in muck. Over time, the growing
                    trees and the muck store a significant amount of carbon. Mangroves are a key
                    habitat for spawning and early growth of a variety of fish and shellfish
                    species. The wood is used for firewood and charcoal production in some areas and
                    scientists are now exploring potential medicinal uses for the plants.
Mangrove forests are cleared for coastal development and to make room for shrimp
                    farms and other human activities. According to one estimate, 20 percent of the
                    worldâ€™s mangrove forests were lost between 1980 and 2010. Based on the
                    information above and perhaps on your own knowledge or reasoning, list three
                    benefits to humans that are provided by intact mangrove forests.
