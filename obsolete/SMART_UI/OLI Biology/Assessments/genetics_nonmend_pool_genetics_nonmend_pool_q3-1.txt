Use the following information to answer the next three questions.
In humans, there are three alleles for blood type: A, B, and O. A and B are codominant
            over O. Suppose Jim, a man with type A blood, and Leah, a woman with type B blood, have
            a child, Winnie. Jim’s parents both have blood type AB. Leah’s mother has type B, and
            her father has type O. 
Part 1 of 3: What is the probability that Winnie’s blood type will be AB?
