Anne Smith is a 38 year old Caucasian female who was recently diagnosed with
                leukemia (cancer of the blood cells). She had undergone 2 rounds of chemotherapy and
                has to have blood work done to check her levels of red blood cells, white blood
                cells, and platelets. Her last results showed a decrease in her red cells and
                platelets. Why might this have happened?
