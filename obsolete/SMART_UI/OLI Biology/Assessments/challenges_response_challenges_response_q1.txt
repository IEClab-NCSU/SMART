                    Examine the first part of the diagram below of the Telomerase Process for
                    lengthening strands of chromosomes. If the rules for DNA polymerase directed
                    synthesis are observed, to which strand would DNA polymerase want to add dNTPs?
                    What would it need to satisfy the substrate requirement for DNA polymerase to
                    conduct the synthesis?
