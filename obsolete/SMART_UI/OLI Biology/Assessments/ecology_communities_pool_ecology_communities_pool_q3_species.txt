A sample of insects and other invertebrates is collected from an urban stream. A total
            of 244 individuals is collected from 2 m2 of stream bottom habitat. In this
                sample there are 22 recognizably different types of invertebrate. The average total
            length of the individuals is 6.7 mm. What is the best estimate of species richness based
            on these data?
