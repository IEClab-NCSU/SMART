Over time, Bill continues to lose weight. At first he is averaging about one pound
				per week of weight loss. Gradually the rate of weight loss slows down, even though
				he sticks to the exact same level of calorie intake and exercise each day. Why, with
				the same calorie intake and activity level, would Billâ€™s weight loss slow down as he
				gets thinner?
