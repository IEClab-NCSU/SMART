Charles Darwin, English scientist, published the outlines of his theory of
                evolution by natural selection. Forcefully argued for the common ancestry of all
                life. Proposed a mechanism for adaptation (natural selection) and related it to the
                artificial selection practiced by plant and animal breeders. Features of organisms
                could have emerged through an automatic, natural process.
