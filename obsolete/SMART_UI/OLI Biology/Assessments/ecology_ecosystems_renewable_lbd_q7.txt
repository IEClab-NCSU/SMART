Rare earth elements are used in making lasers, batteries, magnets, and many other
                high-tech components. These elements are mined from “rare earths”: unusual deposits
                where the elements are concentrated. Today most rare earth elements are mined in
                China and there is concern that their supply could be depleted or cut off.
