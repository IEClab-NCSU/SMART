Replication of DNA begins at specific nucleotide sequences called .
As the DNA strands are separated, an open complex is formed with a  at either end of the replication bubble. 
In prokaryotes, replication starts at  site(s) on the
                    genome. 
In eukaryotes replication starts at  site(s) on each
                    chromosome.
