In the human stomach, proteins are digested by pepsin, an enzyme that requires an acidic pH
				for its optimal function. Antacids are medications that increase stomach pH.
				Examples include Alka-Seltzer, Tums, and Rolaids. If a person overuses antacids, how
				do you think this might affect that person's digestive process?
