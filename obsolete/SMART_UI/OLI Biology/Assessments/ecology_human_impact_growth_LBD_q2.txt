Total fertility is the total number of children a woman produces over a lifetime.  Throughout the world, death rates are now so low (and chances of survival so high) that women must produce on average just over two children to replace herself and her mate.  Total fertility rates that are higher than this will produce population growth over time.  Below shows a map of fertility rates by country.  Look for the overall patterns among the different continents and regions.

Estimates of total fertility rate (total number of children produced over a lifetime) by nation in 2012.  Blue colors denote low total fertility rates below 2 children per woman.  Green represents a total fertility of 2-3 children per woman, near the replacement rate.  Shades of yellow, orange, red, and purple represent high fertility rates in excess of 4 children per woman.

Where are total fertility rates high, implying continued fast population growth?
