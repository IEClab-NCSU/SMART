Antibiotics kill 99.9% of the Streptococcus bacteria that have infected an
                individual’s throat, but 0.1% of the bacteria contain genetic differences that allow
                them to survive and multiply. The resistant bacteria become very common within days,
                which translates to hundreds of generations in “bacterial time.”
