DNA replication occurs at a rate of 50 bp/sec both on closed circular DNA
                        and on linear chromosomes. A piece of closed circular DNA contains a million
                        bp and a piece of linear chromosome has a thousand times more bp inits
                        sequence. If the two chromosomes are to finish replicating in the the same
                        amount of time, how many origins of replication are there in the linear
                        sequence?
