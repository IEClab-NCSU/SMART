At Valley Forge NHP, we estimated that the annual per capita birth rate for deer
                in 1985 was about 0.65 births per deer. We also estimated the annual per capita
                death rate at 0.26 deaths per deer. Based on the numbers above and assuming the
                population was closed (no immigration or emigration), what was the annual per capita
                rate of increase for the population?  deer added per
                deer per year
