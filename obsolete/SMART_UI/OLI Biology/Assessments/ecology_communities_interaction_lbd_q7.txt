On the left, a bee visits a flower. The bee obtains food (nectar and pollen) and
                    moves pollen from one flower to another, helping the plant mate successfully. On
                    the right, a bird eats a berry from a tree. The bird obtains food (fruit) but
                    does not destroy the seed inside each berry. Instead the seeds pass through the
                    bird’s digestive tract intact. They may sprout from the bird’s feces if
                    delivered to a suitable spot. Left image by aussiegall(flickr) (Raspberries to you) CC BY 2.0 Right

                What kind of interaction exists between bee and flowering plant and between bird
                and tree?image needs to be added
