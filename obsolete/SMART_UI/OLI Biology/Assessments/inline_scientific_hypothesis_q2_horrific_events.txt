When terrible things happen (hurricanes hit cities, people develop cancers, etc.)
				some people claim that such events are punishments for the past immoral behavior of
				the people involved. Imagine that someone claims that tornadoes are a punishment for
				bad thoughts and behavior. Is this a scientific claim?
