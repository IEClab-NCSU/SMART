This is as far as we can go with the taxa and data from our Table. It leaves out
                    thousands of living species and thousands of extinct species known only from
                    fossils. But gives a sense for how these species are organized into nested
                    groups.

One important thing to note is that just as a characteristic can be gained by
                    evolution, it can also be lost. For this reason, real phylogenetic trees must be
                    built by analyzing many different inherited characteristics. Organisms do not
                    “change clades” simply because one important characteristic has changed.
Recall that tetrapods are named for having four limbs. Snakes are scaly amniotes
                    closely related to four-limbed lizards. Are they tetrapods?
