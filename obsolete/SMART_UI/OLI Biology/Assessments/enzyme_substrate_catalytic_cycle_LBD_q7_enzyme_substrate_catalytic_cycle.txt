For each process description, determine the step in the catalytic cycle in which the process occurs, designated with numbers in the above diagram.
The enzyme undergoes a conformational change causing an induced fit between the
					substrate and enzyme. This stabilizes the transition state of the substrate as
					bonds are being reorganized.
