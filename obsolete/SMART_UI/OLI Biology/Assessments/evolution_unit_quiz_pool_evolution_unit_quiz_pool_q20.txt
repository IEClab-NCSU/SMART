A flowering shrub is introduced to North America as an ornamental plant. Beetles
            that normally feed on a different North American plant species begin to live and
            feed on the introduced shrub. Their appearance and seasonal schedule begin to shift
            as they adapt to feeding on the new plant host. Gradually the beetles on the
            introduced shrub form a distinct species that does not breed with the original
            source population of beetles. This is an example of ___________.
