Charles Lyell, English geologist, published Principles of Geology. Extended and
                popularized ideas of James Hutton. Challenged notion of a young Earth shaped by
                dramatic catastrophes or acts of magic. Argued that landscapes were ancient and were
                shaped by slow natural processes. The present is the key to the past. Instead of
                speculating about theology, scientists can test ideas about past events by studying
                similar processes at work today.
