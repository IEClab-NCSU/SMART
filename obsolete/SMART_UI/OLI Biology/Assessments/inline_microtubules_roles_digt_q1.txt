In the eukaryotic cell during mitosis, mitotic spindles are composed of
                         and originate from the .
 
There are 3 types of mitotic spindles that aid in mitosis.
(1)  microtubules are responsible for anchoring the
                    centrioles at the poles. 
(2)  microtubules overlap and help elongate the cell
                    by moving the poles farther away from each other. 
(3)  microtubules attach to the chromosomes to help
                    orient them and separate sister chromatids.
