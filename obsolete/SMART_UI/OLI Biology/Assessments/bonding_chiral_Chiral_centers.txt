In the figure below a 3-D representation of 2-sulfo-proprionic acid is shown on the left. The chiral carbon is indicated. Attached to this carbon are four different groups: 1. a methyl group, 2. a carboxyl group, 3. a sulphur atom, and 4. a hydrogen atom.

How many chiral centers does glucose have?
