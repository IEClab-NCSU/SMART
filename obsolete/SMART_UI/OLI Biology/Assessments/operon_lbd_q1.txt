                    The lac operon, like all operons, is controlled by a repressor protein (called
                    the
                    lac repressor,
                    coded by the lacI gene); an operator
                    sequence that binds the lac repressor (when the lac repressor is bound, RNA
                    polymerase cannot make mRNA); and the structural genes lacZ, lacY, and lacA.
                    Which of the following diagrams is likely to be the correct structure of the lac
                    operon?
