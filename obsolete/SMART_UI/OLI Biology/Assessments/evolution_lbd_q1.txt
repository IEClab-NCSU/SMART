Medievel scholars extended on original works by Socrates and Aristotle. Idea is
                that everything (dirt, rocks, plants, animals, humans, angels) could be ranked in a
                complete system of increasing perfection with God at the top. Belief was that
                animals and plant species could not become extinct because each was a single link in
                an unbreakable Chain.
