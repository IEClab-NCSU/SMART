In eukaryotes, post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA usually involves 3
                    steps. At the 5' end of the pre-mRNA a  is added.
                    This modification serves to  and . 
 
At the 3' end of the pre-mRNA a(n)  is added. This
                    modification serves to  and  the mRNA. 
 
In the middle of the pre-mRNA, sections called  are
                    excised while sections called  are ligated together
                    via a process referred to as . This process is
                    carried out by the .
