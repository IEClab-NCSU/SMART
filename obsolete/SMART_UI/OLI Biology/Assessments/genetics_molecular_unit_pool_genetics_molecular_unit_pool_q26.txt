The DNA sequence of the expression plasmid adjacent to the ribosome binding site
            is: ---GGATCCATCTGCGAATTC----
---CCTAGGTAGACGCTTAAG---
It contains a BamH1 site (G^GATCC) and a EcoR1 site (G^AATTC). In order for the
                synthetic gene to be inserted between these two sites, it should be constructed
                to have which restriction sites at its beginning and at its end?
