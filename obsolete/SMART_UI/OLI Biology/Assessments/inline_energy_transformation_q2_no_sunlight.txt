Imagine a glass box (terrarium) containing living plants and animals and sitting on a windowsill. The growth of the plants provides 
			food for snails, insects, fungi, and bacteria that live in the box. Vents allow good air circulation. What will happen if you put a 
			black cloth over the box, cutting off all light?
