The researchers found that, of the 1,200 women in the control group, nine were infected
				with HPV at the end of the study. Of the 1,200 women in the experimental group, zero
				were infected with HPV. Does this result support the original hypothesis, that the
				HPV vaccine would reduce HPV infection?
