The DNA sequence of the expression plasmid adjacent to the ribosome binding site
                    is: 
---GGATCCATCTGCAGATCT----
---CCTAGGTAGACGTCTAGA----
It contains a BamH1 site (G^GATCC) and a BglII site (A^GATCT). In order for the
                    synthetic gene to be inserted between these two sites, it should be constructed
                    to have which restriction sites at its beginning and at its end? Select all that apply.
