In addition to chlorophyll, plants produce other pigments.  
                    Some of them act as “helpers” to chlorophyll: they absorb different 
                    wavelengths of light and pass some of the energy to chlorophyll.  
                    For example, many plants contain orange and yellow pigments in their leaves. 
                    They are normally masked by the green chlorophyll, which is much more 
                    abundant in leaf tissues.  When do we see these pigments in many plant 
                    leaves?
