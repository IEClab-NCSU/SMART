You are studying mitosis in dog skin cells. You observe a cell under a microscope
				that contains two sets of 39 chromosome pairs located on opposite sides of the cell.
				You also note that it looks like nuclear envelopes are beginning to form around the
				chromosomes at each side of the cell. The cell you observed is in which stage of
				mitosis?
