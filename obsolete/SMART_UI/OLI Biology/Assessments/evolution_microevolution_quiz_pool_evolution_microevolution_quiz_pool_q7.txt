A population of pond snails has two genetically determined types: one with a black
            stripe on its shell and one with a plain brown shell. Evidence indicates that there is
            absolutely no difference between the two snail types in terms of their fitness: each
            type survives, grows, and mates with the same average level of success. Over time,
            black-striped snails become more or less common in a population due to chance events. At
            one point, for example, the pond nearly dries up and the few surviving snails happen to
            be mostly black-striped. This evolutionary change is the result ofâ€¦
