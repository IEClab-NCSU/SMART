The presence of a spine and skull is a shared inherited characteristic of all of
                    the species. It doesn’t help us decide how these species are related to each
                    other, but it places all of them in a larger clade called the “vertebrates.” The
                    species listed all have a common ancestor that had a spine and backbone, and
                    they inherited this feature from that source.
These animals share many ancestral characteristics. For example, they all have
                    cells with nuclei (they are in the domain Eukarya) and their bodies are
                    symmetrical along the midline (they are all in a clade called the Bilateria). At
                    the moment we are more interested in how these animals differ from each
                    other.
Which remaining characteristic is most widely shared among the species
                    listed?
