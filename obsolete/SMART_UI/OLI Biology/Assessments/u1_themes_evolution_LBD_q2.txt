Scientists turn to model organisms — species that are easy to keep in the lab and
                    have been studied extensively — and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice,
                    for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have
                    been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop
                    problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How
                    could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions —
                    questions that are, after all, about humans?
