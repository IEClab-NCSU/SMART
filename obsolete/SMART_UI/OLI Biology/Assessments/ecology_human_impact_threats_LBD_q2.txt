The
                Tasmanian Wolf, or thylacine, is a pouched mammal (marsupial). Though it is more
                closely related to opossums and kangaroos, it evolved adaptive behaviors and a body
                structure that closely resemble those of a fox or wolf. In historic times it was
                found only on Tasmania off the coast of Australia. Introduced wild dogs competed
                with the thylacine for prey. Thylacine habitat was also damaged or destroyed by
                sheep ranching and other human activities. Finally, the thylacine was persecuted
                because settlers believed that it attacked sheep and poultry. A land company paid
                bounties to hunters who brought in over 2,000 dead thylacines. The last known wild
                thylacine was killed in 1930.
