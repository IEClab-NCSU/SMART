Tissues that play an important role in forming barriers between extracellular spaces connect through 
                     which create a water tight seal between cells. 
 
Another type of cell junction, , do not form a seal between
                    cells; but instead, prevent neighboring cells from being pulled away from each
                    other. 
 
In addition to attachment, cell junctions can facilitate cellular communication.
                         exist in animal cells and provide a channel between
                    neighboring cells that allow quick exchange of small molecules. Plant cells also
                    contain cellular communication junctions called , which
                    form passages in the cell wall to connect the cytoplasm of neighboring
                    cells.
