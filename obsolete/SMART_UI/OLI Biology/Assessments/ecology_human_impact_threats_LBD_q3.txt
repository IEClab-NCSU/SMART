>The Guam rail has
                been severely endangered by the introduced brown tree snake, which was brought
                accidentally to Guam in military shipping crates. Like other birds native to Guam,
                the rail evolved in the absence of snake predators. It is flightless and its nesting
                behaviors make it easy prey for the snake. The bird is maintained in captive
                breeding colonies at zoos and conservation centers. It has been introduced to two
                small islands near Guam that lack the brown tree snake. These colonies have been
                somewhat successful though one of them is threatened by feral introduced house cats.
