Three anglers are arguing about how a lakeâ€™s fish population should be managed.
            Historically the lake has been totally closed to human fishing. For many years it has
            held a steady population of about 100,000 fish. Managers are planning to open the lake
            to fishing with a limited harvest. To decide on the harvest limits, they first need to
            set a goal. Select the strategy that would probably generate the largest sustainable
            harvest of fish each year.
