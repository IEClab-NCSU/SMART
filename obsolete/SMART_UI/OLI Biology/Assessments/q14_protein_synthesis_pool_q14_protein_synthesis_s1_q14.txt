It is possible to convert the Cys that is a part of Cys-tRNACys to Ala by a catalytic reduction. If the resulting Ala-tRNACys were added to a mixture of (1) ribosomes, (2) all the other tRNAs and amino acids, (3) all of the cofactors and enzymes needed to make protein in vitro, and (4) mRNA for hemoglobin, where in the newly synthesized hemoglobin would the Ala from Ala-tRNACys be incorporated?
