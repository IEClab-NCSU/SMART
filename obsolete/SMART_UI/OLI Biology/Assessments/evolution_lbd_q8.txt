Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, French zoologist, published Philosophie zoologique. One of
                only a few explicit theories of evolution before Darwin, though Lamarck called it
                “transmutation.” Argued that life forms are related by ancestry and that species
                change and adapt over long periods of time. Proposed a mechanism for how evolution
                works that was later discredited, but inspired and emboldened Darwin and
                others.
