An area of ocean supports a striped bass population. In this part of the ocean,
                the phytoplankton grow by 10,000 units of energy each year. In keeping with the
                energy pyramid concept, zooplankton accumulate 1,000 units of energy as growth
                annually. Roughly how many units of energy would striped bass store as growth each
                year?
