Letâ€™s say we go to a dandelion-free area (a newly cleared field, great dandelion habitat)
				and start a small group of dandelions with half of each type. They flower and set
				seed. The next season, we measure the numbers of each type of dandelion among the
				offspring of the original colony. What are we likely to find?
