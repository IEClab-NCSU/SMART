Using the radio dials at the right, select
            increasing concentrations of substrate to investigate how the concentration of substrate affects the reaction velocity, v. The reaction velocity is just the rate of product formation/unit time, under steady-state conditions.
You can view the molecular events that occur in the upper animation and the velocity versus substrate is plotted on the lower graph.
Select [S]=2, and mentally note how frequently the enzyme molecules have substrate. Now make [S]=4.
<b>What happens to the average number of enzymes with substrate bound when [S] is increased from 2 to 4?</b>
