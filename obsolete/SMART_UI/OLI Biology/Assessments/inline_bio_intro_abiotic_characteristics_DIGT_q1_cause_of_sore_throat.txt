You go to the doctor complaining of a fever and sore throat. The doctor examines
				the back of your throat using a tongue depressor and pen light. “Looks like a pretty
				nasty sore throat,” he comments, not very helpfully. “We’ll have to see if we can
				figure out what’s causing it. It could be Streptococcus bacteria, but it’s probably
				a virus.” Then he inserts a swab into the back of your throat and rubs it around to
				get a sample. Ouch! 
The sample is sent off to the lab. Once in the laboratory, the
				technicians take the swab and gently slide it across the surface of a Petri dish
				containing nutrient agar (a plate containing food for bacteria). The dish is closed
				and placed in a warm incubator for 48 hours. After the required time has elapsed,
				the lab technicians examine the plate for the growth of cells. Various tests are
				then used to determine if any of the microbes present are the Streptococcus bacteria
				that cause strep throat. 
Question: There are many microbes growing on the dish, but none are
				Streptococcus. What do you think the doctor will conclude about the cause of your
				sore throat?
