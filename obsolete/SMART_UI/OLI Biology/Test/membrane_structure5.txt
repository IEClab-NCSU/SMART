 As discussed above and seen in the picture, the cell membrane is
									asymmetric. The extracellular face of the membrane is in contact
									with the extracellular matrix. The extracellular side of the
									membrane contains oligosaccharides that distinguish the cell as
									self. It also contains the end of integral proteins that
									interact with signals from other cells and sense the
									extracellular environment. The inner membrane is in contact the
									contents of the cell. This side of the membrane anchors to the
									cytoskeleton and contains the end of integral proteins that
									relay signals received on the external side.
