					<title>Fluid Quality of Membranes</title>
					<body>
						<p>The cell membrane must be a dynamic structure if the cell is to grow and
							respond to environmental changes. To keep the membrane fluid at
							physiological temperatures the cell alters the composition of the
							phospholipids. The right ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids
							keeps the membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life. For
							example winter wheat responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing
							the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes. In animal cells
							cholesterol helps to prevent the packing of fatty acid tails and thus
							lowers the requirement of unsaturated fatty acids. This helps maintain
							the fluid nature of the cell membrane without it becoming too liquid at
							body temperature. The fluidity of the membrane is demonstrated in the
							following animation. The lipids in the membrane are in random bulk flow
							moving about 22 µm (micrometers) per second. Phospholipids freely move
							in the same layer of the membrane and rarely flip to the other layer.
							Flipping of phospholipids from one layer to the other rarely occurs
							because flipping requires the <xref idref="d_hydrophilic" page="definitions_index">hydrophilic</xref> head to pass through the
							<xref idref="d_hydrophobic" page="definitions_index">hydrophobic</xref> region of the bilayer.

							<title>Proteins</title>
							<body>
								<p>Because the cell membrane is only semipermeable, the cell needs a
									way to communicate with other cells and exchange nutrients with
									the extracellular space. These roles are primarily filled by
									proteins. Membrane proteins are classified into two major
									categories, integral proteins and peripheral proteins.  Integral
									membrane proteins are those proteins that are embedded in the
									lipid bilayer and are generally characterized by their
									solubility in non-polar, hydrophobic solvents. Transmembrane
									proteins are examples of integral proteins with hydrophobic
									regions that completely span the hydrophobic interior of the
									membrane. The parts of the protein exposed to the interior and
									exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. Integral proteins can
									serve as pores that selectively allow ions or nutrients into the
									cell. They also transmit signals into and out of the cell.
									Unlike integral proteins that span the membrane, peripheral
									proteins reside on only one side of the membrane and are often
									attached to integral proteins. Some peripheral proteins serve as
									anchor points for the cytoskeleton or extracellular fibers.
									Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly. Some
									move in seemingly directed manner while others drift.</p>

							<title>Carbohydrates</title>
							<body>
								<p>The extracellular surface of the cell membrane is decorated with
									carbohydrate groups attached to lipids and proteins.
									Carbohydrates are added to lipids and proteins by a process
									called glycosylation, and are called glycolipids or
									glycoproteins. These short carbohydrates, or oligosaccharides,
									are usually chains of 15 or fewer sugar molecules.
									Oligosaccharides give a cell identity (i.e., distinguishing self
									from non-self) and are the distinguishing factor in human blood
									types and transplant rejection.</p>

						</section>
						<section>
							<title>Membranes are Asymmetric</title>
							<body>
															
								<p> As discussed above and seen in the picture, the cell membrane is
									asymmetric. The extracellular face of the membrane is in contact
									with the extracellular matrix. The extracellular side of the
									membrane contains oligosaccharides that distinguish the cell as
									self. It also contains the end of integral proteins that
									interact with signals from other cells and sense the
									extracellular environment. The inner membrane is in contact the
									contents of the cell. This side of the membrane anchors to the
									cytoskeleton and contains the end of integral proteins that
									relay signals received on the external side.</p>

			<title>Summary: Membranes as Mosaics of Structure and Function</title>
			<body>
				<p>The biological membrane is a collage of many different proteins embedded in the
					fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer. The lipid bilayer is the main fabric of the
					membrane, and its structure creates a semi-permeable membrane. The hydrophobic
					core impedes the diffusion of hydrophilic structures, such as ions and polar
					molecules but allows hydrophobic molecules, which can dissolve in the membrane,
					to cross it with ease. Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific
					functions. The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each
					have unique collections of proteins. For example, to date more than 50 kinds of
					proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells.</p>
