    "# clusteredText = ' Does a virus meet the definition of a cell? No Correct _ Although viruses do have a boundary between themselves and the environment, this boundary is a protein layer for many viruses _ For those viruses with a membrane, they lack other features found inside cells _ Therefore, they do not qualify as cells _ Some viruses are surrounded by a membrane structure, but not all of them are _ Viruses are particles that exist inside a living cell _ Viruses do not contain the machinery for growth and replication _ They must use the host cell‚Äôs machinery for their own replication _ A virus can reproduce only when the DNA is replicated inside of the cell of a living organism _ . You started life as a single cell, and took on your current form through a process of development and growth _ Why do cells in different parts of your body have different functions and characteristics? Each type of cell uses its DNA differently _ The DNA is similar, but DNA reacts to conditions and makes different products in each kind of cell _ Correct _ Through development, different cells come to behave differently _ They use different parts of the common ‚Äúrecipe book.‚Äù As a result, they produce specific proteins that allow them to carry out a specialized function _ Every time a cell divides, its DNA is copied and each of the resulting cells gets one full copy of the DNA from the original cell _ If two kitchens have identical libraries of recipe books, how might they still make very different meals? With very few exceptions, the cells in your body have similar DNA in their nuclei _ Each cell in your body has a similar set of ‚Äúrecipes,‚Äù but most of the recipes are not used _ In each specialized cell type, only a subset of products are made, and these give the cell its unique functions.. Which of the following is/are found in eukaryotic cell membranes? Select the single best option _ all of the above Correct..

When a cell is placed in an unknown solution, the cell rapidly swells and bursts _ Which of the following would be true? The external solution is hypotonic relative to the cytoplasm of the cell _ Correct..  A zygote grows into an organism through what process? Mitosis Correct _ A zygote is the cell formed when a sperm fertilizes an egg _ Zygotes grow into adult through countless rounds of mitosis, which produces two identical daughter cells from a single cell _ A zygote is formed when egg and sperm meet _ In order for a zygote to grow, two identical daughter cells must be produced from a single cell _ Zygotes grow through mitosis.. A skin cell is an example of: a somatic cell Correct _ A somatic cell is a nonreproductive cell in a multicellular organism.. During the S phase of the cell cycle, DNA is replicated _ What form would you expect the DNA to be in? Unwound Correct _ DNA in chromatin form is easiest to replicate..  During the M (mitosis) phase of the cell cycle, what form would you expect the DNA to be in? Tightly wound around the histone proteins _ Correct _ In this form the chromosomes are compact and easy to move as the new cells are forming _ . Interphase is the part of the cell cycle when the cell: _ grows and duplicates its DNA _ Correct _ The cells grows in G1, duplicates its DNA in S, and makes final preparations in G2 _ DNA has to be copied (or replicated) before cell division occurs _ Cell division takes place during M _ In which phase is the cell growing and preparing to divide?.  In which stage of the cell cycle are new daughter cells formed? Cytokinesis Correct _ During cytokinesis the cytoplasm and membrane of the parental cell is split in order to form two daughter cells _ . In which stage of the cell cycle would you expect the growing of the cell to occur? G1 Correct _ During G1, the cell is growing (amassing nutrients and making the preparations for the remainder of the cell cycle) and the chromosomes condense in preparation for DNA synthesis and mitosis _ . In which stage of the cell cycle would checking for DNA integrity occur? G2 Correct _ During G2, the integrity of the newly replicated DNA is checked _ If there were errors in the replication of the DNA, the new daughter cells could be defective and harmful to the organism _ Therefore, the quality of the DNA is inspected during the G2 phase to ensure that each daughter cell is getting a good copy of the DNA _ . A muscle cell is an example of what type of cell? a somatic cell Correct _ A somatic cell is a non-reproductive cell in a multicellular organism.. DNA that is tightly wound around histone proteins is the easiest to replicate _ Is this statement true or false? False Yes _ Tightly wound DNA is not easy to replicate.. DNA that is tightly wound around histone proteins is the easiest to divide _ Is this statement true or false? True Yes _ When the DNA is tightly wound around histone proteins, it is easy to make sure one copy of each chromosome gets into the daughter cells.. During the S phase of the cell cycle, DNA is replicated _ What form would you expect the DNA to be in? It would be in a loose pile _ Yes! DNA in chromatin form is easiest to replicate.. During which stage of the cell cycle is the DNA replicated? S Yes _ This is a stage in interphase when the DNA is replicated.. During what stage of the cell cycle does the cell grow and carry out it regular functions? G1 Yes! G1 is the stage in which the cell carries out its daily functions.. If a cell is not dividing, and has not yet begun replicating its DNA what phase of the cell cycle would it be in? G1 Correct _ G1 occurs before DNA replication (S).. If you found a single cell with two nuclei, what explanation might be true? Mitosis occurred without cytokinesis! Yes _ If mitosis occurs, a cell will have two nuclei _ Cytokinesis must occur before there are two new cells.. All of the following pairings between a cell cycle phase and what happens during it are correct, except S- the cell is dividing Correct! Before the cell divides it has to copy its DNA, which happens during the S-phase of the interphase.. What role does mitosis play in the overall cell cycle? Mitosis is the process of dividing a parent cell into two genetically identical daughter cells _ DNA in the nucleus, which contains the genetic information, is first duplicated and condensed into tightly packed thread-like structures called chromosomes _ During the four phases of mitosis, the nucleus is separated and divided into two identical daughter nuclei _ Each daughter nuclei contains the same genetic material as the parental cell _ .  After completing the above activity, answer the following questions _ The inner circle in the above diagram is what part of the cell? Think about what function(s) that part perform(s) _ nucleus Correct _ The nucleus protects the chromosomes; it must be dismantled for mitosis to proceed _ The inner circle represents the control center of the cell..  At the end of the S stage, how many chromosomes will exist in the cell? double the number Correct _ During the synthesis (S) stage, the DNA is replicated so that the nucleus can be divided during mitosis and result in two genetically identical cells _ Chromosomes contain DNA and protein _ During the synthesis (S) stage of the cell cycle, DNA is duplicated _ Double the amount of DNA results in a duplicate number of chromosomes.. Explain what happens to the cell during the prophase of cell division _ The DNA condenses and the nuclear membrane begins to breakdown _ .  How many pairs of chromosomes will be found in each daughter canine skin cell after mitosis occurs? 39 Correct _ Each daughter cell will have 39 pairs of chromosomes, just like the parental cell..  You are studying mitosis in dog skin cells _ You observe a cell under a microscope that contains two sets of 39 chromosome pairs located on opposite sides of the cell _ You also note that it looks like nuclear envelopes are beginning to form around the chromosomes at each side of the cell _ The cell you observed is in which stage of mitosis? Telophase Correct _ In telophase, the daughter chromosomes have been pulled to opposite poles of the cell (which happened in anaphase), and a new nuclear envelope forms around each group of chromosomes.. What do proto-oncogenes do? They encourage the process of cell division _ Correct _ Proto-oncogenes encourage cell division.. Which function most closely describes how BOTH tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes work? They regulate the cell cycle _ Correct _ While both genes have different functions, they both affect cell division by regulating the cell cycle.. An organism grows through what process? Mitosis Yes! Mitosis is cell division that results in growth..  Cancer can be the result of all of the following EXCEPT? A functional tumor suppressor gene and a functional proto-oncogene _ Correct _ Proto-oncogenes give the cell a signal to undergo cell division but only when the cell should be dividing _ Tumor suppressor genes, inhibit cell division so that a cell cannot divide uncontrollably _ It is when only these genes are both non-functional, that they can result in cancer development.. What is different about the second cell? In the first cell, the chromosomes are all one color _ In the second cell, the chromosomes have more than one color _ Correct _ In the second cell, crossing over occurred and the homologous chromosomes swapped DNA _ Look at the color of the chromosomes.. Prior to meiosis, the cell must go through the ‚ÄúS‚Äù stage of the cell cycle _ What happens during this stage? DNA is copied _ Correct _ The DNA is copied in the S stage of the cell cycle _ ‚ÄúS‚Äù stands for \"synthesis,\" which means building _ Prior to dividing the chromosomes, they must be replicated.. Does the DNA in the skin cell have the same backbone as DNA in the brain cell of the same organism? Yes, all backbones of ALL DNA molecules are the same _ Correct! Since backbone is made of sugar and phosphate - there is no room for variation, it is always the same.. What process is responsible creating distinct sets of proteins in skin cell compared to brain cell? Gene Expression Correct. Does the DNA in the skin cell have the same sequence of bases as the DNA in the brain cell of the same organism? Yes, the sequence of bases should be the same in all cells of an organism _ Correct: Yes! We start out as a single cell and make a copy of DNA at each cell division, giving rise to different cell types _ Notice the word ‚Äúshould‚Äù‚Ä¶mutations do occur when DNA is not copied perfectly and some cells will have small changes in DNA sequence.. When a cell is getting ready to divide into two cells (during the process of mitosis), which process must first happen so that the entire genome can be passed to the new daughter cells? DNA replication Correct _ DNA replication produces a new double helix _ Each of these DNA molecules can then be passed on to the daughter cells..  Linear DNA: Eukaryotic only Eukaryotes have chromosomes made of linear DNA molecules..  DNA in nucleus: Eukaryotic only Only eukaryotic cells have a nucleus..  Circular DNA: Prokaryotic only Correct _ Prokaryotic cells have circular chromosomes and plasmids _ The nuclear genome of eukaryotic cells is composed of linear chromosomes..

A dog skin cell containing 78 chromosomes is a diploid cell _ True Correct _ Dog skin cells are somatic cells and contain two copies of each of the 39 chromosomes _ This makes them diploid _ Dog gamete cells (eggs or sperm) are haploid and contain only one copy of each chromosome.. Which of the following tasks is accomplished through the process of mitosis? Replacement of dysfunctional cells Yes _ Mitosis enables dysfunctional cells to be replaced.. What is the name of the process of asexual cell division that results in daughter cells that are identical to the parent cell? Mitosis Correct _ Mitosis is the cell division that results in two identical daughter cells _ Cell division is part of the cell cycle _ Somatic cells and germ cells reproduce asexually _ Somatic cells undergo mitosis.. What is the name of the process of sexual cell division that results in daughter cells that are NOT identical to their parent cell? Meiosis Correct _ Meiosis does not result in identical daughter cells _ Cell division is part of the cell cycle _ Somatic cells and germ cells reproduce asexually _ Somatic cells undergo mitosis..  A hypothetical cell has a chromosome number of 2n = 16 _ Which of the following statements is TRUE? The diploid cells from this species have 8 homologous pairs of chromosomes _ Correct _ The cell has 2n = 16 chromosomes, so n = 8 _ This means the cell has 8 different chromosomes, but has 2 copies of each _ ‚ÄúN‚Äù refers to the number of chromosome sets in a cell _ In diploid cells (2n), chromosomes are in pairs.. How many chromosomes are there in each cell AFTER meiosis I? 2 Correct _ If you count the centromeres, you‚Äôll see that now there are two chromosomes in each cell _ The number of chromosomes in the cell was cut in half _ This is why meiosis I is called the ‚Äúreduction division.‚Äù The cell on the left is before meiosis I _ The 2 cells on the right are at the end of meiosis I, and about to enter meiosis II _ Count the number of centromeres in each cell to determine the number of chromosomes _ The cells on the right each have two centromeres.. Meiosis is important for sexual reproduction in all of the following ways except? Maintaining proper function of the germ cells Correct _ Germs cells produce gametes (egg and sperm) through meiosis _ Meiosis does not maintain the function of the germs cells _ Maintaining the proper functioning of germ cells is the job of hormones..  At the end of telophase II, the number of chromosomes is 1N (haploid) Correct _ At the end of meiosis, the daughter cells are haploid and contain one copy of each chromosome _ The parental cell was diploid and had two copies of each chromosome..  Meiosis and sexual reproduction produce genetic variability in all of the following ways except? Producing identical daughter cells Correct _ Identical daughter cells are produced in mitosis and since they have identical genes and chromosomes, this does not increase genetic diversity.. What is the purpose of meiosis? To enable an organism to produce gametes Yes _ Meiosis results in haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Which of the following tasks is accomplished through the process of meiosis? Production of sperm or eggs Yes _ Meiosis results in sperm or egg production.. Mitosis results in _ cells and meiosis results in _ cells _ diploid, haploid Yes _ Mitosis results in diploid cells and meiosis results in haploid cells.. Mitosis results in _ and meiosis results in _ _ somatic cells, gametes Yes _ Mitosis results in somatic cells and meiosis results in gametes.. Corn has 20 chromosomes _ When corn undergoes meiosis how many chromosomes are found in the gametes? 10 Correct _ Meiosis results in half the number of chromosomes.. Cats have a diploid number of 38 _ How many chromosomes are in a cat egg? 19 Correct _ Haploid cells have half the number of chromosomes as diploid cells.. How many cells are present after meiosis I? 2 Correct _ Meiosis I produces two cells _ Meiosis has two stages; this question is asking how many cells are present after meiosis I only _ Meiosis I is only halfway through the process of meiosis and would have produced half the total number of cells _ Although meiosis results in four cells, meiosis I is only halfway through the process and has only produced half the total number of cells.. After meiosis I, these cells will enter meiosis II _ How many cells are present after meiosis II? 4 Correct _ Each of the two cells divides again to produce four total cells _ Each of the cells from meiosis I divides again in meiosis II _ Meiosis I ends with two cells, each of which divides again.. How many gametes does a diploid cell make during meiosis? four haploid cells Correct _ Meiosis produces four haploid cells _ Meiosis produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell _ The original cell was diploid _ Meiosis produces four cells.. What percentage of the gametes produced will have the ‚ÄúA‚Äù allele? 50% Correct _ Two of the four cells have this allele _ Review the images above; how many of the cells have an ‚ÄúA‚Äù? Of the four cells above, two have an ‚ÄúA,‚Äù and two have an ‚Äúa.‚Äù. What percentage of the gametes produced will have the ‚Äúa‚Äù allele? 50% Correct _ Two of the four cells have this allele _ Review the images above; how many of the cells have an ‚Äúa‚Äù? Of the four cells above, two have an ‚ÄúA,‚Äù and two have an ‚Äúa.‚Äù. What is the name of the type of cell division that gives rise to gametes (reproductive cells)? meiosis Correct _ Meiosis results in haploid gametes (reproductive cells).. Which of the following is true of a diploid organism? All of the above _ Correct _ A diploid organism has two chromosomes, two genes, and each gene has two alleles.. A haploid organism has how many copies of each chromosome? 1 Correct _ A haploid organism has one of each chromosome.. How many copies of each gene does a diploid organism have? 2 Correct _ A diploid organism has two of each chromosome, and therefore two of each gene.. The cells of your body are surrounded by water _ The outer layer of these cells is made of many nonpolar molecules _ What would happen if the outer layer of these cells was made of mainly polar molecules? The cells would dissolve _ Correct _ The nonpolar characteristic of this layer allows cells to survive in an aqueous environment.. Skin cells perform very different functions compared to brain cells _ On the molecular level, what makes skin cells different from brain cells in the same organism? Proteins Correct. '\n",
