Sunlight Yes! Sunlight is the only source of energy for most producers, including algae and plants _ Light is used to “power” the chemical reactions of the plant, and in particular it is used to build food for the plant using the process of photosynthesis _ Remember: nutrients are not the same as energy sources _ You are looking for energy sources, so you shouldn’t select a solid, liquid, or gas _ What would happen if you put a plant in a dark box? Would heating the air or soil make any difference?"
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow_LBD_q2,"Which of the following would be correct for the ""Energy Out"" box? Heat Correct! Heat is a form of energy _ It is seen in the disorganized movement of molecules _ When the plant carries out any activity in its cells, heat energy is generated and released _ Any living thing radiates heat into its environment, and plants are no exception _ Remember to keep the focus on energy _ If it can be weighed or measured in terms of volume, it’s matter, not energy _ With the right kind of camera it is possible to “see” plants releasing this form of energy _ If you put a thermometer into a pile of sprouting beans, you can directly observe how much heat a plant can generate."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow_LBD_q4,"Now let’s consider how consumers fit in, and answer the question about whether energy is recycled _ Which of the energy outputs from a producer are potentially useful energy inputs for a consumer? Calories in living organic matter Useful energy inputs for consumer _ Right! Consumers can eat living producers and get energy from this food _ Consider: could any animal or fungus or other consumer eat this? If so, it is a correct answer _ Remember that many animals, fungi, and bacteria specialize in eating dead stuff _ Heat, though it is comforting at times and keeps our temperature at a favorable level, cannot give us any chemical energy to do work."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow_LBD_q5,"Calories in dead organic matter Useful energy inputs for consumer _ Right! Many consumers eat dead producers; termites and fungi both consume dead wood, for example _ Consider: could any animal or fungus or other consumer eat this?

In other words, it exits the “consumer” box permanently and would be placed in the ""Energy Out"" box in the diagram below _ Heat _ Right again! All plants release heat to the environment _ So do all consumers _ This disorganized form of energy (heat) spreads out from its source as random motion of materials, or as a form of radiation similar to light (infrared or heat radiation) _ Humans, other mammals, and birds are particularly heavy “heat leakers.” Infrared cameras mounted to helicopters can allow police to find suspects hiding in a garden shed: their body heat gives them away! Remember to keep the focus on energy, not matter _ What was the form of energy that left producers and then just spread out into space? The same is true for consumers."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_heat_energy_LBD_q1,"Okay, so we’re closing in on an answer _ Energy starts as sunlight, is passed around among consumers as chemical energy (calories) in food, and is released every step of the way as heat _ Ultimately, what happens to this heat energy? Heat is not recovered and it is not recycled _ It spreads out into space, never to return _ Fresh sunlight allows life to continue _ Correct _ Energy flows through life and is not recycled _ All of us depend on freshly renewed sunlight energy; most of the calories in our food were sunlight sometime in the past year or two! Even where it is very warm, a plant deprived of light will die _ Energy cannot be turned to matter under normal conditions found on the surface of the earth _ The sun gets its energy from nuclear reactions that occur when hydrogen atoms collide under extreme heat and pressure _ In these conditions, matter is converted to energy and this energy is released as light from the sun _ With respect to Earth, the sun is totally self-sufficient."

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_nutrients_DIGT_q4," Examples are light, heat, and calories in organic food molecules: Energy Correct _ Light and heat are forms of energy _ Calories are a unit of energy _ Sometimes stored chemical energy is the important thing about food _ When we are specifically referring to energy we’ll often use the phrase “calories in .” to make that clear."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_nutrients_DIGT_q5," Constantly renewed source is required to keep life on Earth going: Energy Correct _ We don’t need new atoms to keep life going — we just keep reusing the ones we already have _ But energy is different _ A fresh, high-quality supply is needed to keep life moving and to replace all the heat lost to the environment."

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_interdependence_DIGT_q1,"Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body _ There are many good answers _ Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes _ On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain _ You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow _ Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another _ This is the core of the “interdependence” concept."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_interdependence_DIGT_q2,"Identify and briefly explain an example of interdependence between humans and other species in an ecosystem _ Once again, there are lots of possible answers _ We humans are dependent on algae and plants that produce food and oxygen gas, animals we harvest as food, and decomposers that get rid of wastes _ They, in turn, may be dependent on us for cultivation (in the case of crop plants), protection, or a supply of food (the helpful bacteria in our sewage treatment plants would starve without us!) _ You probably came up with your own answer _ Did the answer specifically describe how humans depend on the other species AND how the other species depends on us? If so, you’ve got a good grasp of interdependence."

We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice _ Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn’t be possible with people _ Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry _ We have similar organs, cells, and molecules _ Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study _ To learn more: Genetic Science Learning Center "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_dandelion_LBD_q1,"Dandelion seeds have light wispy fruits, or “parachutes.” This feature increases the distance a seed can be carried on the wind _ Seeds that land close to the parent plant are often at a disadvantage because of crowded conditions _ Consider two dandelion types: one with fluffy parachutes and one with heavier, less fluffy parachutes _ Which type of plant is likely to produce more offspring over a wider area? The type with the fluffy parachutes _ Correct _ This plant will spread its seeds more widely _ Each seed will probably have more room to grow, improving its odds of survival _ Which seeds are more likely to find good growing conditions: those deposited in a small area next to the parent, or those spread a good distance away in less crowded conditions? In most cases, seeds that disperse farther will have a better shot at surviving to reproduce."
