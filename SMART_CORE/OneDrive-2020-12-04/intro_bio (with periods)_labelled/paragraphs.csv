_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1m1_life_hierarchy_v23,"Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large _ In this course, the smallest level we will examine is the atom, which is the basic unit of matter _ The atom consists of a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons _ Atoms join together to form molecules _ A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a chemical bond _ Macromolecules are biologically important molecules, and they are technically polymers _ Polymers are made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler macromolecules _ An example of a macromolecule is the genetic molecule deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains the instructions for the development of all living organisms _ DNA is built of four kinds of monomers (nucleotides) _ They are strung together, or polymerized, in a sequence that codes for the structure of proteins and other biological molecules _ The DNA in one of your microscopic cells contains a sequence of almost three billion nucleotides."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1m1_life_hierarchy_v24,"When macromolecules are used as building blocks to form a membrane-bound sphere, you have a cell, which is the fundamental unit of life _ A cell is essentially a tiny droplet of water and other molecules enclosed by a fluid “skin” or membrane _ The cell is the smallest and simplest entity that possesses all the characteristics of life _ There are two main types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes _ The cells of prokaryotes are relatively small and simple; they do not have any clearly defined compartments inside of them _ The cells of eukaryotes, by contrast, include membrane-bound organelles: compartments inside the cell that contain specific groups of macromolecules and carry out specific cellular functions _ One of these organelles is the nucleus; it encloses the DNA within the cell."

_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1m1_emergent_properties1,"Life is organized into hierarchical levels of increasing complexity _ The study of biology involves all these levels, from single atoms or molecules up to global relationships among organisms and the environment _ As we ascend through this hierarchy to more and more complex levels, emergent properties appear _ These are characteristics of a system that are not present in any of its component parts _ Take, for example, an automobile _ The separated parts of the automobile amount to a heap of junk _ Only when properly assembled, with gas, the right key, and a human driver, does the car fulfill its function, which is to transport us from place to place _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1m1_emergent_properties2,"Life is an emergent property, and one that appears at the cellular level of organization _ Molecules are not alive, but they are the components of life _ More than 2,000 years ago, Aristotle said “The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.” In biology, this is a constant theme: we can learn much about a system by looking at its details, but we also must step back and look at the big picture to truly understand the workings of life."

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_homeostasis1,"Living organisms detect and respond to changes in the conditions of their external environment _ In response to threats and opportunities, organisms may move or change their activities _ For example, plant stems can grow toward a source of light _ Over time, the trunks of trees strengthen when they are flexed by the wind _ Animals, of course, respond to stimuli with a huge range of behaviors from the hibernation of bears to your own development of “goosebumps” on a chilly day."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_homeostasis2,"In contrast to the extreme variability of the outside world, the interior of a cell is a remarkably constant environment _ For example, cells typically keep their internal pH (acidity) within a narrow range _ This is important because changes in pH can cause molecules like enzymes to change their shapes _ As you already know, a molecule’s shape (or structure) determines its function _ If its shape changes, it may lose function _ Because of this, many of the chemical reactions of life will not work properly if cell conditions change too much _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_homeostasis3,"The ability or tendency of organisms and cells to maintain stable internal conditions is called homeostasis _ The term homeostasis comes from the Greek words homeo (same, alike) and stasis (standing) _ It describes how life stands in one place despite many changes in the surrounding world _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_homeostasis4,"Environmental conditions can also affect cellular homeostasis _ If the cell’s surroundings change quickly, conditions inside the cell may be temporarily disturbed _ Organisms react to these changes in a corrective way: they detect changes and do something to oppose them _ For example, when you get cold, your muscles start to contract in rapid bursts, causing you to shiver _ The process of shivering then generates heat that warms you back up again _ As a result of this and other adjustments, your temperature is maintained close to 99 degrees F (Fahrenheit) [37 degrees C (Celsius)] _ At this temperature, your enzymes work very efficiently _ "

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow1,"All cells (or organisms) take in forms of matter called nutrients and release chemical waste products _ Nutrients and wastes are made of atoms; they occupy space and have mass _ Organisms also must take in and use some form of energy to grow, move, etc _ and release waste energy as heat _ Energy can be defined as the capacity to do work or to make a change in the location, temperature, or structure of matter _ It cannot be weighed and does not take up space, but it can be measured in terms of what it does The nutrients in a sandwich can be weighed on a scale _ The energy in the same sandwich can be measured by burning it, capturing the released heat in water, and measuring how much the water’s temperature increases as a result."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow2,"Humans and other consumer must eat or absorb complex food molecules derived from the bodies of other organisms _ Food provides nutrients; we get the building blocks for our bodies from the food we consume _ Food also provides chemical energy (calories) that can be used for movement, growth, etc _ Producers such as plants do not eat or absorb complex food molecules _ Instead, they absorb very simple nutrients like water and carbon dioxide gas _ They then use energy from sunlight to make their own food from these simple nutrients _ All organisms - both consumers and producers - process foods and absorb useful energy and building blocks _ The leftovers are released as simple wastes to the environment _ The atoms that make up matter are very durable and they flow in an endlessly repeated cycle between producers, consumers, and the nonliving environment."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow3,"You might think that energy is recycled like this, too _ Let’s see if that is correct."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow4,"As you have seen, the flow of energy is in one direction _ Nearly all the energy available to organisms within the biosphere comes from the sun (solar energy) and ultimately dissipates back to space as heat."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow5,"Energy flow and nutrient cycling are themes in biology at every level _ In your body, energy from food is processed and released, explaining the existence of body heat _ Excess energy intake leads to weight gain that can threaten your health _ A proper balance of nutrients is required to give you the building blocks you need to grow and maintain your body’s tissues _ Chemical waste products must be removed by organs like your liver, kidneys, and lungs."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_flow6,"At the ecosystem level, energy flow explains why food chains are usually short and predators are often rare: energy is released as heat as it passes through each feeding level in an ecosystem _ Nutrient cycling traces how consumers and producers interact to alter the chemistry of the air, water, and soil _ By studying nutrient cycles, we can appreciate the roles of algae and plants in making our air breathable _ We learn how bacteria make soil fertile _ In energy flow we see chains that tie us to the sun; in nutrient cycling we see ties that bind all living things to each other."

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter1,"Matter is traditionally defined as anything that has mass and takes up space _ Matter is made of atoms _ Matter is reused and recycled in living systems _ To live and grow, organisms and cells must take in (or absorb, or ingest) certain forms of matter _ Any matter an organism needs but cannot make for itself is considered a nutrient for that organism _ Not all matter can be used by an organism, which is why all living systems release other forms of matter _ When an organism or cell releases (or excretes) matter, the excreted matter is considered waste for that organism _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter2,"Both nutrients and wastes are made of atoms; they occupy space and have mass _ The atoms retain their identity through the processes of life, even though they can be combined with other atoms in different ways _ Consider the picture above _ When a wolf is eaten by a bear, the atoms that made up the wolf become part of the bear _ The matter in the wolf that is not absorbed or used for growth by the bear becomes waste _ The bear excretes this waste in urine, in feces, and in its exhaled breath _ Atom for atom, all the matter that was the wolf can be accounted for, and it is recycled through the ecosystem _ The waste produced by one organism can provide nutrients to another _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter3,"Energy can be defined as the capacity to do work or to make a change in the location, temperature, or structure of matter _ Energy does not have mass and it does not take up space, but it can be measured in terms of what it does _ Energy comes in many forms, including heat, chemical potential energy, kinetic energy of motion, and light _ Energy is required for all organisms to maintain homeostasis, grow, and reproduce _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter4,"It is important at this point to clarify the difference between matter and energy and to highlight a form of energy that is very important in biology _ Food contains nutrients that are useful to humans _ These nutrients take up space and can be weighed _ Imagine a serving of breakfast cereal _ You can weigh and measure the volume of its nutrients, and on food labels nutrient content (the amount of fat, carbohydrates, protein, etc.) is reported in grams _ But the same serving of cereal also has a property called chemical potential energy _ This is energy stored in the structure of molecules that can be converted to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction _ If the cereal is burned (a chemical reaction), its molecules will react with oxygen gas _ Atoms will change partners and the molecules will become much simpler _ In the process, energy will be released as heat and light _ We can determine the amount of energy in the cereal by burning it and measuring how much heat is released in the process _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter5,"In biology, chemical potential energy is a key form of energy _ It is measured in units called calories _ When we’re talking about energy, we’ll say “the calories stored in .” or “the chemical potential energy of .” a substance _ We are talking about what the substance can do if it is put through a chemical reaction, like burning, that will release its stored energy _ Returning to the breakfast cereal example, nutrition labels indicate the chemical potential energy of food by listing the calories per serving _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_energy_and_matter6,"Energy and matter move through living systems in different ways _ Energy flows through living systems, changing forms as it goes _ For example, the energy in sunlight is captured by green plants, which use this energy to build sugar molecules _ The energy from the sun is now stored in the sugar and when an organism eats the sugar, the stored energy can be harvested and used to do work _ The energy flows through the system; it is never recycled _ Matter, on the other hand, cycles within living systems _ For example, the atoms in the sugar molecule start out as nutrients, and will ultimately become waste _ The waste might become nutrients for something else _ Those same atoms will be used over and over again _ Energy flow and nutrient cycling are themes in biology at every level _ "

_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_growth1,"All organisms grow and develop _ Growth is just an increase in size _ In development, structure and function change in an orderly way as an organism passes through its life cycle _ An individual’s pattern of development is partly determined by genetic instructions _ DNA, the molecule of inheritance, encodes proteins and other molecules that build cells and make them work _ You can think of genes as “recipes” for proteins _ Each cell has a huge library of thousands of recipes in its DNA _ But most of the recipes don’t get used in any given cell _ Chemical controls tell the “cooks” whether to make a given protein, or ignore its recipe and make something else _ Therefore, even though your cells share the same DNA, their activities change radically in different parts of your body and at different stages of development."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_growth2,"In this time-lapse video, a few days of development are sped up for your viewing pleasure _ In the earliest frames you can see large cells dividing _ With each division the individual cells get smaller _ Chemical signals in each cell are passed to its descendants and to nearby cells _ As a result, DNA is turned “on” or “off” in each cell, leading to different shapes and structures _ Toward the middle and end of the video, individual cells are much too tiny to see _ Specialized cell types form _ Cells move from place to place, grow, die to create gaps, and divide to create bulges _ In this way, body structures begin to emerge."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_growth3,"Reproduction occurs when an individual organism passes on its genetic information to a newly independent organism, or offspring _ Individual organisms have a limited life span _ All are subject to extreme events that bring death, such as being eaten by a predator _ Even if they avoid such a fate, most organisms decline in health and die toward the end of their typical life span _ Reproduction maintains genetic information by passing it to new individuals _ Offspring resemble their parent(s) and reproduction maintains the continuity of life over time."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_evolution_v11,"Evolution is a scientific theory that explains how and why life changes over time _ Evolution provides the explanation for why all living organisms share profound similarities, and yet, the life forms on our planet are so incredibly diverse _ The two fundamental tenets of evolution are shared ancestry and natural selection _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_evolution_v12,"As you learned previously in this module, reproduction results in the passing of characteristics from parents to offspring and maintains the continuity of life _ You can see this in a family photograph: offspring resemble their parents and siblings resemble each other _ Biologists look at all life on the planet and see the same patterns."
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_evolution_v13,"According to evolutionary thinking, life forms are similar because of their shared ancestry _ All cells have DNA as the molecule of inheritance and they also share many other detailed features _ Organisms and cells always come from parents, and this is where they get their genetic information _ Trace this process back in time, and it is reasonable to suppose that all life forms inherited DNA and many other features from a long-ago common ancestor _ The unity of life is very striking when we examine molecules, which can be almost identical in species as different as bacteria and whales _ This unity of structure and function is also evident when we compare skeletons, kidneys, or hearts among animals _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,u1_themes_evolution_v14,"The second major idea of evolution is that of natural selection _ Natural selection helps explain how groups of organisms become well-suited, or adapted, to their surroundings _ Individuals are always a bit different from their parents and from each other, partly because of changes to their genes _ These differences may be helpful or harmful to the individuals that inherit them _ In nature, individuals often have very low odds of surviving to reproduce _ Individuals with slightly harmful or even average characteristics might be less likely to make it, and those with traits that fit in very well with the local habitat will have the greatest chance to survive and reproduce _ This sorting process goes on generation after generation _ Each time only a tiny fraction of those born are well-suited and lucky enough to pass their genes along; the others die, leaving no descendants _ As generations of time pass, inherited features that help organisms produce offspring become more common within a population _ Harmful features that reduce reproduction become less common _ Many experiments have demonstrated the effects of natural selection on populations in the laboratory and in nature _ The process of natural selection is one way that scientists have explained the vast diversity of life on our planet."

_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_01,"Science is a powerful tool used to understand the natural world _ It is the process that has resulted in the knowledge we are exploring in this course _ However, the process of science does have limitations _ In other words, there are some questions that science cannot be used to answer _ For example, science cannot answer questions about supernatural things _ It also cannot be used to make moral or aesthetic judgments _ While questions of these types may be important for humans to explore, the process of science cannot be used to study them _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_02,"In this module, the process of science will be discussed in more detail _ Then you will learn about how to design a quality scientific experiment _ Finally, you will have the opportunity to practice identifying examples of science and to compare those to examples of pseudoscience, or things that claim to be scientific, but are not _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_what_is_science_11,"Science is a process that helps us to understand how the natural world works _ When we use the term “natural” in this context, we mean all that can be observed with our senses or with instruments that extend our senses _ The “natural” world studied by science can be reliably observed and measured, from the far reaches of outer space to the man-made chemicals in our air and water _ This module will examine the process of science and explore how science has led to an increased understanding of living organisms _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_what_is_science_12,"Biology is an example of a scientific field that deals with understanding living organisms _ Chemistry is a scientific field that deals with understanding atoms and molecules _ Overall, scientific fields can be broken down into two main branches: natural sciences, and social and behavioral sciences _ Social and behavioral sciences focus on human cultures and the behaviors of humans in groups and as individuals _ Biology is a natural science that includes many related sub-branches, such as ecology, biochemistry, and microbiology _ Each sub-branch of biology examines different aspects of living organisms _ Other natural sciences are physical sciences like chemistry and physics _ It is important to remember that even though scientific knowledge is broken into branches and sub-branches of study, the knowledge gained from the various scientific disciplines is interconnected _ For instance, to understand how a cell responds to a certain environmental signal, it is necessary to know about the chemical composition of that signal, so the science of chemistry is important to understand the science of biology _ Likewise, understanding how the brain functions (neuroscience) can aid in understanding the human behaviors studied in the social and behavioral sciences."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_11,"Science deals with testable knowledge about physical phenomena in the universe _ The goal of science is to understand how the universe works _ Biology focuses on understanding living things _ To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called “scientific inquiry.”"
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_12,"Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and predicting natural phenomena _ Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of science-based technologies _ Take medicine, for example _ Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders _ Some of these prescientific remedies worked, but the process for discovering new treatments was a slow and haphazard system of trial and error _ Ineffective treatments were often accepted simply because there was no clear procedure for evaluating them _ Today, with science-based medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health _ According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900 _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_13,"Scientific inquiry has not displaced faith, intuition, and dreams _ These traditions and ways of knowing have emotional value and provide moral guidance to many people _ But hunches, feelings, deep convictions, old traditions, or dreams cannot be accepted directly as scientifically valid _ Instead, science limits itself to ideas that can be tested through verifiable observations _ Supernatural claims that events are caused by ghosts, devils, God, or other spiritual entities cannot be tested in this way."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_14,"The rest of this module will focus on the methods of scientific inquiry _ Science often involves making observations and developing hypotheses _ Experiments and/or further observations are often used to test the hypotheses, and the data gathered are carefully interpreted _ Methods and results are then communicated to other scientists within peer-reviewed scientific journals."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_15,"A scientific experiment is a carefully organized procedure in which the scientist intervenes in a system to change something, then observes the result of the change _ Scientific inquiry often involves doing experiments, though not always _ For example, a scientist studying the mating behaviors of ladybugs might begin with detailed observations of ladybugs mating in their natural habitats _ While this research may not be experimental, it is scientific: it involves careful and verifiable observation of the natural world _ The same scientist might then treat some of the ladybugs with a hormone hypothesized to trigger mating and observe whether these ladybugs mated sooner or more often than untreated ones _ This would qualify as an experiment because the scientist is now making a change in the system and observing the effects."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a1,"When conducting scientific experiments, researchers develop hypotheses to guide experimental design _ A hypothesis offers a testable and falsifiable explanation of observations _ For example, a scientist might observe that maple trees lose their leaves in the fall _ She might then propose a possible explanation for this observation: “cold weather causes maple trees to lose their leaves in the fall.” This statement is testable _ The scientist could grow maple trees in a warm enclosed environment such as a greenhouse and see if their leaves still dropped in the fall _ The hypothesis is also falsifiable _ If the leaves still dropped in the warm environment, then clearly temperature was not the main factor in causing maple leaves to drop in autumn."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a2,"In the activity below, you can practice recognizing scientific hypotheses _ As you consider each statement, try to think as a scientist would: can I test this hypothesis with observations or experiments? Is the statement falsifiable? In other words, is it possible to gather evidence that clearly indicates that the statement is not true? If the answer is “no,” the statement is not a valid scientific hypothesis."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a3,Determine whether each following statement is a scientific hypothesis.
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a4,"Throughout the rest of this module, we examine the scientific process by discussing an actual scientific experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Washington to investigate whether a vaccine may reduce the incidence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) _ The experimental process and results were published in an article titled, ""A controlled trial of a human papillomavirus type 16 vaccine"" [1] , available for viewing online at the National Institutes of Health's online database of publications: PubMed.gov"
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a5,Preliminary observations made by the researchers who conducted the HPV experiment are listed below: 
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a6," Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States _ There are about 40 different types of HPV _ A significant number of people that have HPV are unaware of it because many of these viruses cause no symptoms _ Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer _ About 4,000 women a year die of cervical cancer in the United States _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_2a7,Researchers have developed a potential vaccine against HPV and want to test it.
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_31,You’ve successfully identified a hypothesis for the University of Washington’s study on HPV: People who get the HPV vaccine will not get HPV _ 
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_32,"The next step is to design an experiment that will test this hypothesis _ There are several important factors to consider when designing a scientific experiment _ First, scientific experiments must have an experimental group _ This is the group that receives the experimental treatment necessary to address the hypothesis."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_33,"The experimental group receives the vaccine, but how can we know if the vaccine made a difference? Many things may change HPV infection rates in a group of people over time _ To clearly show that the vaccine was effective in helping the experimental group, we need to include in our study an otherwise similar control group that does not get the treatment _ We can then compare the two groups and determine if the vaccine made a difference _ The control group shows us what happens in the absence of the factor under study."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_34,"However, the control group cannot get “nothing.” Instead, the control group often receives a placebo _ A placebo is a procedure that has no expected therapeutic effect — such as giving a person a sugar pill or a shot containing only plain saline solution with no drug _ Scientific studies have shown that the “placebo effect” can alter experimental results because when individuals are told that they are or are not being treated, this knowledge can alter their actions or their emotions, which can then alter the results of the experiment."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_35,"Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also influence the results of the experiment _ Without saying so directly, the doctor may show — through body language or other subtle cues — his or her views about whether the patient is likely to get well _ These errors can then alter the patient’s experience and change the results of the experiment _ Therefore, many clinical studies are “double blind.” In these studies, neither the doctor nor the patient knows which group the patient is in until all experimental results have been collected."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_36,"Both placebo treatments and double-blind procedures are designed to prevent bias _ Bias is any systematic error that makes a particular experimental outcome more or less likely _ Errors can happen in any experiment: people make mistakes in measurement, instruments fail, computer glitches can alter data _ But most such errors are random and don’t favor one outcome over another _ Patients’ belief in a treatment can make it more likely to appear to “work.” Placebos and double-blind procedures are used to level the playing field so that both groups of study subjects are treated equally and share similar beliefs about their treatment."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_37,"The scientists who are researching the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine will test their hypothesis by separating 2,392 young women into two groups: the control group and the experimental group _ Answer the following questions about these two groups."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_3a1,"A variable is a characteristic of a subject (in this case, of a person in the study) that can vary over time or among individuals _ Sometimes a variable takes the form of a category, such as male or female; often a variable can be measured precisely, such as body height _ Ideally, only one variable is different between the control group and the experimental group in a scientific experiment _ Otherwise, the researchers will not be able to determine which variable caused any differences seen in the results _ For example, imagine that the people in the control group were, on average, much more sexually active than the people in the experimental group _ If, at the end of the experiment, the control group had a higher rate of HPV infection, could you confidently determine why? Maybe the experimental subjects were protected by the vaccine, but maybe they were protected by their low level of sexual contact."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_3a2,"To avoid this situation, experimenters make sure that their subject groups are as similar as possible in all variables except for the variable that is being tested in the experiment _ This variable, or factor, will be deliberately changed in the experimental group _ The one variable that is different between the two groups is called the independent variable _ An independent variable is known or hypothesized to cause some outcome _ Imagine an educational researcher investigating the effectiveness of a new teaching strategy in a classroom _ The experimental group receives the new teaching strategy, while the control group receives the traditional strategy _ It is the teaching strategy that is the independent variable in this scenario _ In an experiment, the independent variable is the variable that the scientist deliberately changes or imposes on the subjects."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_3a3,"Dependent variables are known or hypothesized consequences; they are the effects that result from changes or differences in an independent variable _ In an experiment, the dependent variables are those that the scientist measures before, during, and particularly at the end of the experiment to see if they have changed as expected _ The dependent variable must be stated so that it is clear how it will be observed or measured _ Rather than comparing “learning” among students (which is a vague and difficult to measure concept), an educational researcher might choose to compare test scores, which are very specific and easy to measure."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_3a4,"In any real-world example, many, many variables MIGHT affect the outcome of an experiment, yet only one or a few independent variables can be tested _ Other variables must be kept as similar as possible between the study groups and are called control variables _ For our educational research example, if the control group consisted only of people between the ages of 18 and 20 and the experimental group contained people between the ages of 30 and 35, we would not know if it was the teaching strategy or the students' ages that played a larger role in the results _ To avoid this problem, a good study will be set up so that each group contains students with a similar age profile _ In a well-designed educational research study, student age will be a controlled variable, along with other possibly-important factors like gender, past educational achievement, and pre-existing knowledge of the subject area."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_41," After the experiment is completed, results are compiled and interpreted _ This involves the measurement of the dependent variable _ In the case of our HPV experiment, remember, the dependent variable is the rate of HPV infection _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_42,"Although the HPV study suggests that the vaccine protects against infection by HPV, is the finding significant? In science, as in life, things can happen for many different reasons _ A convincing study will rule out “luck” (random chance) as an explanation for the results _ Strong results are said to be significant: very unlikely to occur by chance or random events."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_43,"Whether the outcome is significant often depends on the size of study; the larger the number of individuals enrolled, the more convincing the results are likely to be _ For example, imagine only 10 women were enrolled in the study _ In the control group, 2 in 5 of the women became infected _ In the experimental group, 0 in 5 were infected _ At first you might think this proves the vaccine’s effectiveness, but it is NOT a convincing or significant result _ Why not? Random events could easily explain the difference between the groups _ For example, perhaps none of the five women in the experimental group were sexually active over the study period _ They therefore stood no chance of acquiring HPV _ The vaccine might appear to work, but a skeptical reader could account for the results by proposing many other scenarios."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_44,"However, imagine if the same study were done with 10,000 women, and the infection rates were 2,000 of 5,000 in the control group and zero of 5,000 in the experimental group _ Random events would be spread out among a very large group of people in this study; on average, the two big groups should have similar sexual behavior and other factors influencing infection rates _ If there is a big difference at the end of the study, it is very unlikely that this result occurred by random chance."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_45,Statistical analyses did support the significance of the HPV vaccine result _ 
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_46,"After the results are interpreted and conclusions are drawn, researchers often return to their work and begin asking further questions _ In this way, scientific inquiry is a powerful tool for exploration."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_4a1," Now that you have a pretty good idea about the process of science, you’ll have a chance to identify examples of science and compare those to examples of pseudoscience _ "
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_4a2,"Pseudoscience is any claim that purports or pretends to be scientific in nature, but does not actually have the characteristics of true scientific inquiry _ Pseudoscientific ideas often involve the supernatural _ Sometimes they involve claims about forces or processes that cannot be measured using traditional tools or instruments employed by scientists _ Finally, pseudoscientific claims are often quite dramatic _ They are “amazing” ideas that would seem strange or unlikely to most scientists working in a related field."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_4a3,"The clearest line separating pseudoscience from “real” science is publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals _ These are publications, usually run by scientific societies or academic publishing companies, in which scientists publish their findings according to a well-established system of oversight _ Before it gets published in such a journal, a piece of research is carefully reviewed by two or more researchers in the same field of study _ The methods and logic of the paper are evaluated carefully, and if it makes bold or unusual claims, the study is subject to especially close scrutiny _ Reviewers and editors may demand not just rewrites, but also additional evidence if a claim is weakly supported."
_u800_Bio_Intro,_u1_intro_scientific_inquiry_4a4,"Truly scientific research is published in reputable peer-reviewed journals _ These journals exclude pseudoscience rigorously _ If you hear that some idea is “scientifically proven,” check the source to see if there’s any reference to a scientific journal _ Track down the article to see if it really supports the claim _ Finally, double check to make sure that the publication is a respected peer-reviewed journal _ One way to get this information is to ask a scientist at a research university, consult with a librarian, or do a careful Internet search _ Your ability to distinguish between science and pseudoscience will help you be a scientifically literate citizen."

_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_intro_v32,"The cell is the fundamental unit of life; therefore, you might think that your study of biology should begin with the cell _ In fact, before you can truly understand how a cell functions, you must understand the building blocks from which cells are made _ In the Introduction to Biology module, you learned that all life exhibits a hierarchical organization _ While cells are the first level of organization that displays all the properties of life, their component parts (atoms and molecules) are not alive, as illustrated in the inverted pyramid below."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_intro_v33,"To make sense of how cells work, you must constantly return to their parts (atoms and molecules) and the interactions among them _ This is why a clear understanding of some chemistry is essential to understanding how life functions _ This unit will focus on the atom _ You will learn how atoms combine to form different molecules, making up all the diverse matter you see around you _ In this unit, you will explore only nonliving components of the hierarchy of life _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a21,"In this module, you will learn about the basic structure of the atom, the fundamental unit of matter _ Living things are made up of atoms arranged in a complex and nonrandom way _ This is one of the common features of all living organisms _ The atom is the smallest level in the hierarchy of life that we will explore in this course _ Understanding the properties of atoms allows us to predict and understand how atoms interact with one another to build molecules, such as hormones and DNA _ In addition, an understanding of atoms allows us to predict how cells will react to different therapeutic drugs and toxins in the environment."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a22,"All living and nonliving things are composed of matter _ Matter can be defined as anything that occupies space and has mass _ The mass of an object is a measure of how much matter it has (that is, how much “stuff” is in it) _ Mass is not exactly the same as weight, but here on Earth we can measure and compare the masses of different objects by weighing them."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a23,"When we explore matter scientifically, we find that it takes on many different structures as we zoom in at smaller and smaller scales _ Everyday objects are mostly mixtures of molecules, which in turn are made up of atoms _ Even air is a mixture of molecules _ The atom is a good focal point for understanding matter; all matter is composed of atoms _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a24,"Atoms are unimaginably small _ Even within a single microscopic cell, there is room for not just billions, but trillions or even hundreds of trillions of atoms _ Amazingly, however, physicists now understand that most of the volume of an atom is actually made up of empty space _ The atoms themselves are made of even smaller subatomic particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons _ We cannot look at the parts of atoms with a microscope; they are simply too small _ However, physicists have learned a great deal about atoms and subatomic particles through indirect methods _ One model of the atom is shown in the diagram below _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a25,"The number of protons, neutrons, and electrons are characteristics of an atom _ Differences in the number of these subatomic particles are what distinguish one type of atom from another _ Furthermore, each of these subatomic particles has an electrical charge that influences how one atom will interact with another _ Notice in the diagram of an atom above that the protons have a plus sign (+) indicating their positive electrical charge _ Electrons have a negative charge designated by the negative sign (-) _ Neutrons are electrically neutral, neither positive nor negatively charged _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a26,"When the number of protons equals the number of electrons, then the atom is electrically neutral _ If the number of protons differs from the number of electrons, then the atom has an electrical charge _ An atom with more or less protons than electrons is called an ion _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_a27,"The electrical charge of an atom governs its behavior when it comes into contact with another atom; that is, how the atom reacts with other atoms _ Atoms with unlike charges (+/-) will attract each other and connect, binding to form a molecule _ Atoms with like charges repel each other _ That means two atoms both positively charged (+/+) or both negatively charged (-/-) will resist or reject contact _ The changes in the atomic composition of a substance that occur as a result of the attraction or repulsion of two or more atoms is called a chemical reaction _ A chemical reactions produce one or more products resulting from a chemical change that transforms a set of molecules."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_elements1,"You’ve already seen that all atoms have a few structural characteristics in common _ All atoms have a nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons, and are surrounded by electrons _ However, you are probably also aware that not all atoms are the same _ In fact, atoms come in different types, called elements _ There are 92 different kinds of elements that are naturally occurring on Earth _ Each element has its own set of properties that are unique to atoms of its kind _ Elements are designated by either one- or two-letter abbreviations and they can be organized into a chart called the periodic table _ We will take a closer look at the periodic table (also called the periodic chart) later in this unit _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_elements2," Atoms differ from one another in their number of protons, electrons, neutrons, and chemical properties which affect the ability of atoms to combine to form substances _ An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains all of the properties of that element _ So, an element is a substance that is composed of a single type of atom _ But, how do you know what kind of atom you have? It is easy! Count the number of protons in the atom’s nucleus, and that will tell you what kind of element that atom is _ The number of protons in an atom is denoted by the atomic number displayed for each element in the periodic table _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_elements3,"All hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron _ In contrast, all carbon atoms contain six protons, six electrons, and six neutrons _ It is the number of protons found in the nucleus of the atom that determines the kind of element designated by the atom."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_elements4,"In biological systems, the major elements are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) _ These elements represent more than 95% of the mass of a cell _ Carbon is a major component of nearly all biological molecules _ Some elements are found in relatively small amounts and are called “trace elements.” Examples include sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), and Zinc (Zn) _ Throughout the course you will see how atoms of these elements are very important to the functioning of a cell _ "

_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c11,"Atoms of different elements have many different features, including different sizes and levels of reactivity _ For example, sodium is an incredibly reactive element, especially when it combines with water _ Lead, on the other hand, is relatively inert _ Yet all elements share some regular patterns that make it easier for us to categorize them and understand why they behave as they do."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c12," The first key characteristic that truly identifies an element is its atomic number which is the number of protons in each atom _ The atomic number is constant and identical for all atoms of an element _ For example, hydrogen (H) atoms always have only one proton and have an atomic number of one _ If an atom has two protons, it has an atomic number of two, and it is helium (He) _ For this reason, if you started with one hydrogen atom and added a proton, the original hydrogen would now be helium _ If an atom has three protons in its nucleus, it is a lithium (Li) atom _ Beryllium (Be) has four protons in its nucleus, and so on _ Based on their atomic numbers, elements can be organized into a periodic table of elements like the one pictured below _ The number at the top of each box in the table is the atomic number of the element."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c13,"In addition to providing information about each element’s atomic number, most periodic tables also provide an atomic mass for each element _ The atomic mass, also known as the atomic weight, reports the mass of the nucleus _ The mass of the nucleus is the sum of all protons and neutrons found in the nucleus _ A hydrogen atom has one proton and would therefore have an atomic mass of one _ A carbon atom, which has six protons and six neutrons, would have an atomic mass of 12 _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c14,"The units of atomic mass are Daltons, abbreviated Da, named after the British scientist John Dalton _ One Da is equal to 1.66 x 10-27 kg, which is the mass of a single hydrogen (H) atom _ Helium (He) has a mass of 4 Da or 6.67 x 10-27 kg _ Because the mass of a single atom is so small, it is not a convenient unit for everyday use _ Typically, the atomic mass is multiplied by the number of atoms in a mole to give the atomic weight in grams _ A mole contains 6.022 x 1023 particles and is defined as the number of particles of carbon (C) that give an atomic weight of 12 grams _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c15,"Notice that the atomic mass or atomic weight on the periodic table is not generally a whole number _ For example, the atomic mass of carbon (C) is 12.01 _ How is that possible? Atoms cannot have fractions of protons or neutrons _ The reason for this is that not all atoms of an element have the same number of neutrons _ For example, carbon atoms always have six protons _ But some carbon atoms have six neutrons, while others have seven or even eight neutrons _ A carbon atom that has six neutrons would have an atomic mass of 12; a carbon atom with eight neutrons would have an atomic mass of 14 _ Two atoms with the same atomic number but a different atomic mass are called isotopes _ For example, most atoms of carbon have an atomic mass of 12 _ There are some atoms of carbon with an atomic mass of 13 (carbon 13), and some with 14 (carbon 14) _ These are isotopes of the carbon atom _ Carbon 12 is the most abundant or prevalent isotopic form of carbon _ Because carbon 12 is the most abundant form and taking into account all of carbon's different isotopes, the average value for the atomic mass for carbon is near 12: it's listed at 12.01."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_c16,"Scientists have learned that isotopes have many useful properties _ Some isotopes can be used to trace chemical reactions _ If a special isotope is placed in fertilizer, for instance, that same isotope will later show up in the tissues of plants, then animals and decomposers as the nutrient moves through the food web _ Some isotopes break down into others at a constant rate, allowing us to determine the age of fossils or artifacts _ When an isotope is radioactive, this means that it emits some energy (radiation) when it breaks down to a different isotope _ Radioactive isotopes can be used to visualize certain tissues for medical diagnosis _ For example, radioactive iodine tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland _ It emits radiation as it breaks down to another isotope of iodine _ Special cameras can pick up this radiation and use it to create an image of the thyroid gland _ This can help determine if the patient’s thyroid is normally active or to detect thyroid cancer."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d1,"The electron is the reactive part of the atom _ The number and location of electrons determines the interactions between atoms _ As you recall, negatively charged electrons are pulled toward the positively charged nucleus _ But electrons are kept in orbit by kinetic energy _ Electrons that are close to the nucleus are less energetic than those electrons farther from the nucleus _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d2,Electrons reside in the space outside the nucleus in regions called shells _ There are specific rules for filling up the shells of the atom _ The first shell can hold two electrons; the second and third shells can hold up to eight electrons _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d3,Electrons fill up lower shells before moving to the next higher shell _ The electrons that occupy the outermost shell are called valence electrons and are the electrons that are involved in chemical bonding _ The chemical properties of an element depend mostly on the number of valence electrons.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d4,"A key characteristic of atoms is that they are most stable when they have full outer electron shells _ Helium (He) has a full outer shell with two electrons; directly below it in the periodic table is Neon _ Neon (Ne) has an inner shell with two electrons and a full second shell with eight electrons _ In fact, all of the elements in that column of the periodic table have full outer shells, are stable, and do not react with other elements."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d5,Complete the activity above and then answer the following questions.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d6,"Opposite charges cancel each other out when they are close together _ So what would you predict about the overall charge of an atom with an equal number of protons and electrons? That’s right — it is neutral _ There is no charge; the atom will not be attracted to or repelled by charged objects _ All atoms, in their elemental state, have equal numbers of protons and electrons, and for this reason they have no net charge _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d7,"As you recall, an atom is most stable when it has a full outer shell _ Some atoms achieve this endpoint by taking on extra electrons, or giving them up _ When this happens, the atom becomes an ion and it takes on an overall charge _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d8,"Some elements readily take on one or more extra electrons _ They become anions that carry a negative charge, because they have more electrons than protons _ On the periodic table, elements to the right (with the exception of the last column) are likely to take on extra electrons _ For example, chlorine (Cl) has seven electrons in its valence shell _ It is likely to take on one extra electron to fill its outer shell, becoming an anion with a charge of -1 _ The same can be said for other elements in the same column with chlorine _ Conversely, elements on the left side of the periodic table tend to give up one or more electrons and become cations with a positive net charge _ For example, sodium (Na) has one electron in its valence shell _ It readily gives up this electron, becoming a cation with a charge of +1 _ The same can be said for lithium (Li) and other elements in this column."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_d9,"In the next section, we will explore how these electron transfers occur, and will look at some of the other ways that atoms interact to achieve stable, full outer electron shells."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_e1,"Scientists have learned to use isotopes in many different ways _ For example, stable isotopes can be used to trace chemical reactions through a food web _ For example, if a stable isotope is used in fertilizer, that same isotope will later show up in the tissues of plants, then in animals, and finally in decomposers as the nutrient moves through the food web _ Other isotopes are unstable and they tend to decay (or break down into other isotopes) at a constant rate _ Scientists have learned how to use unstable isotopes to determine the age of fossils or artifacts _ Finally, some isotopes are radioactive _ Radioactive isotopes emit energy in the form of radiation when they decay into different isotopes _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_e2,"Radioactive isotopes can be used to visualize certain tissues for medical diagnosis _ One example of this is radioactive iodine, which tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland _ It emits radiation as it breaks down to another isotope of iodine _ Special cameras can pick up this radiation and use it to create an image of the thyroid gland to determine if the patient's thyroid is functioning normally _ If there is abnormal activity in the thyroid gland, this can indicate cancer _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_e3,"Another example of radioactive isotopes is positron-emission tomography (PET) _ In PET, a patient ingests sugar that is marked with a radioactive isotope _ Cells that are using a lot of sugar (or need a lot of energy) will absorb more of the radioactive isotope _ The patient is then moved into a PET scanner, where the radioactive isotopes are visualized and the machine translates the data into an image _ This can help in a variety of applications, from cancer and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis to addiction research (see image)."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_quiz_wrapper1,"Atoms are the building blocks for all matter _ Now that you understand the structure of the atom, you can use atoms to build more complex structures, like molecules _ This is what you’ll learn about in the next module."

_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_atoms_quiz_wrapper3,"Review the following key terms from this module _ Click on the term to view a definition and any additional information _ When you are ready, check your understanding of atoms by taking the quiz linked below."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding1,Atoms are the smallest units of an element that retain all the properties of the element _ Atoms combine to form a larger and more complex entity called a molecule _ Molecules are composed of two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding2,"Chemical bonds are attractions between atoms that hold atoms and molecules together _ There are three types of chemical bonds that are important in biology: covalent bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds _ Covalent bonds are very stable, while ionic and hydrogen bonds are less stable _ The relatively weaker ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds allow reversible interactions between different molecules in biological systems."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding3,"Joining atoms together builds molecules that are more complex and larger than the individual atoms that compose them _ The table below illustrates some similarities and differences among ionic, covalent and hydrogen bonds."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding4,"The most stable situation for an atom is to have its outer shell completely filled with electrons _ It is not easy to explain why this is true, but it is a rule of thumb that predicts how atoms will react with each other _ Recall from the discussion on electrons, in the Atoms module, that the first electron shell is full with two electrons, and the second and third shells are full with eight electrons _ Atoms tend to bond to other atoms in such a way that both atoms have filled outer shells as a result of the interaction."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_b1,"Ionic bonds are the interactions between ions of opposite charges _ Atoms form ions when they either take up or release electrons in order to fill their outer shell _ Elements in the outer columns of the periodic table often react in this manner; elements like sodium tend to lose electrons and become cations (positively charged ions), whereas elements like chlorine tend to gain electrons and become anions (negatively charged ions)."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_b2,"In fact, the reaction between sodium and chlorine is a great example of ionic bonding, and produces a compound you have in your kitchen — table salt _ Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic number of 17, so it has 7 electrons in its outermost shell _ Chlorine needs one more electron to have a full outer shell."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_b3,"Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11, with one electron in its outermost shell _ Sodium needs to get rid of an electron, and then it will have a full outer shell _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_b4,"By losing an electron, sodium becomes a cation with a positive charge (+1) _ By gaining an electron, chlorine becomes an anion with a negative charge (-1) _ Now each ion has a net charge and the two charges are opposite _ The ions attract one another _ The electrostatic interaction between the sodium ion and the chlorine ion is an ionic bond _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c11,"Instead of transferring their electrons completely, atoms may remain in very close contact and share electrons so that their outer shells are filled _ In essence, a shared electron is counted “twice” and participates in a larger shell that joins the two atoms _ A single pair of shared electrons makes a single covalent bond _ Atoms can share two pairs of electrons (in a double bond), or even three pairs of electrons (in a triple bond)."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c12,This sharing of electrons is called a covalent bond.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c13,"Carbon, for example, has an atomic number of 6 (see the figure below) _ The outer shell of carbon has 4 electrons _ Carbon can share an electron with four other atoms _ Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 _ It has a single electron in its outermost shell, and can share this electron with one other atom _ A carbon atom can form a covalent bond with four hydrogen atoms to form a molecule called methane, CH4 _ In a methane molecule, carbon effectively has a “full” second shell (8 electrons) and each hydrogen has a “full” second shell (two electrons)."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c14,"Nitrogen, another example, has an atomic number of 7 (see the figure above) _ The outer shell of carbon has 5 electrons _ Nitrogen can share an electron with three other atoms _ Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 _ It has a single electron in its outermost shell, and can share this electron with one other atom _ A nitrogen atom can form a covalent bond with three hydrogen atoms to form a molecule called ammonia, NH3 _ In an ammonia molecule, nitrogen effectively has a “full” second shell (8 electrons) and each hydrogen has a “full” second shell (two electrons) _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev1,"When two atoms are joined by a covalent bond, the new structure that forms is called a molecule _ This is in contrast to the structure formed when two atoms are joined by an ionic bond, which is called an ionic compound _ When drawing a molecule on paper, covalent bonds are often drawn as lines between atoms _ A single covalent bond is drawn as one line; a double covalent bond is drawn as 2 lines _ Each atom is represented by its element symbol _ Thus a structural formula of methane (CH4) would be drawn like this: "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev2,"Notice that the carbon in methane has formed four covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms _ Because carbon has four electrons in its outer shell, it can always form four covalent bonds with other elements _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev3,"The molecular mass or weight of a molecule is the sum of the individual atomic weights _ As with atomic weights, it is convenient to use the weight of a mole of molecules _ For example, the molecular mass of a single methane molecule is 16 Da (12 from the carbon, 4 from the hydrogens) _ The weight of a mole of methane molecules is 16 grams _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev4,"Molecules can be much more complex than methane _ Carbon can form long chains as each carbon forms covalent bonds with multiple other carbons _ When drawing molecules, it is important to make sure that each atom has a full outer shell _ In the case of carbon, this simply means that carbon will form four covalent bonds."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev5,"Examine the activity below _ Remember that the lines represent covalent bonds between atoms, but also note that the bonds between O and H are not shown _ This simplifies the drawing and makes important structures easier to see _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev6,Explore the activity above and then answer the following questions.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev7,"Structural Formulas: There are many different ways to draw molecules _ For example, look at the glucose molecule shown on the right in a structural formula _ Notice that the structure consists of a carbon backbone running down the middle of the molecule _ Each carbon has formed a covalent bond with four other atoms _ (The first carbon actually formed two bonds with the oxygen atom; this is called a double bond _ This carbon still formed a total of four bonds, even though two of the bonds are with the same oxygen atom.) "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev8,"Skeletal Formulas: Chains of carbon atoms are very common in carbon-based molecules _ Sometimes such molecules are drawn using skeletal formulas, also known as shorthand formulas _ In these diagrams, the carbon atom, typically indicated with the letter “C,” is not shown _ Instead, each C atom is drawn simply as a corner on the diagram _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev9,"Below are skeletal diagrams of glucose _ In these examples, the carbons are located at each angle in the diagram _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev10,"You may have another question about the skeletal diagrams: what happened to the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms? It looks like some of the carbons only have two or three covalent bonds! The skeletal diagrams are often drawn to be simple, not to show every atom _ It is understood that carbon must have four bonds, and in any carbon-based molecule there are often one, two, or even three hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon _ To clean up the diagram, the H atoms are not drawn _ It is assumed you will understand that any “missing” bond is actually provided by a hydrogen atom."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_c2-rev11,"These conventions simplify diagrams of molecular structures _ The cholesterol molecule, shown below, looks much cleaner than if we had to draw each carbon and hydrogen atom _ You may also notice that this image has different-looking bonds _ These solid and striped triangle-shaped bonds describe the three-dimensional shape of the molecule."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_e1,"Recall that in a covalent bond, the electrons are shared between two atoms _ However, the two atoms don’t necessarily share the electrons equally _ Some atoms are more likely to draw the shared electrons closer to themselves _ Atoms have a high electronegativity if they tend to draw the electrons towards them _ Electronegativity increases as one moves from the left to the right across the periodic table _ Hydrogen is moderately electronegative, with a value of 2.1, carbon is somewhat more electronegative, with a value of 2.5, and fluorine is the most electronegative atom, with a value of 4.0 _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_e2,"The degree of unequal electron sharing depends on the difference in electronegativity of the atoms involved in the bond _ For example, in carbon-carbon bonds, both atoms have the same electronegativity, so the electrons are equally shared between the two carbons _ In contrast, a carbon-oxygen bond involves two atoms that have different electronegativities _ The less electronegative atom (carbon) will donate part of its electrons to the more electronegative atom (oxygen), resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbon (indicated by δ+) and a partial negative charge on the oxygen (indicated by δ-) _ The size of the partial charges is proportional to the difference between the electronegativities of the two bonded atoms _ Bonds in which electrons are unequally shared between the atoms are called polar covalent bonds."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d11,"Throughout this course, you will be studying many different molecules _ Many of the important molecules of life, like DNA, proteins, and even ordinary water, share a key characteristic: they all form hydrogen bonds _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d12,"Hydrogen bonds are not like the covalent bonds you just learned about _ They do not join atoms into molecules _ Instead, they are the attraction of an electronegative atom to a hydrogen that is covalently bonded to another electronegative atom _ This involves the attraction of the hydrogen with a partial positive charge to the electronegative atom with a partial negative charge _ Only hydrogen covalently bonded to an electronegative atom can participate in hydrogen bonding."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d13,"Hydrogen bonding has a significant effect on the properties of molecules _ For example, the structure of the DNA molecule is in part held together by hydrogen bonds _ Hydrogen bonds also create coils and other structures within the complex protein molecules that are essential to life’s diversity _ Finally, water behaves the way it does because of the hydrogen bonds that attract water molecules to each other _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d14,The water molecule is a very important example of a molecule that can form hydrogen bonds _ It is the hydrogen bonding of the water molecules that gives water many of its unique and life-sustaining properties _ One water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a oxygen atom _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d15,"Recall that in a covalent bond, the electrons are shared between two atoms _ However, the two atoms don’t necessarily share the electrons equally _ Some atoms are more likely to draw the shared electrons closer to themselves _ These atoms have a high electronegativity _ Both oxygen and nitrogen are molecules with a high electronegativity _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d16,"In a water molecule, oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen _ This means that oxygen has a greater affinity or attraction for the shared electron pair than hydrogen does _ Because of this, the electrons tend to spend more time close to the oxygen atom and they spend less time close to the hydrogen atom _ As a result, the oxygen becomes slightly negative and each hydrogen atom develops a slightly positive charge _ Whenever two atoms with different electronegativities form a covalent bond, we say that the bond between the atoms is polar, with each atom carrying a partial charge _ Oxygen and nitrogen are the two highly electronegative elements that are often bonded to hydrogen in biological molecules _ O-H and N-H bonds are strongly polar, and this sets the stage for hydrogen bonding."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d17,"Hydrogen bonding is the attraction of an electronegative atom for a hydrogen that is covalently bonded to another electronegative atom _ This involves the attraction of a hydrogen with a partial positive charge to an atom with a partial negative charge _ However, only hydrogen covalently bonded to an electronegative atom can participate in hydrogen bonding."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_d18,"In water, the partially positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to the partially negative oxygen atoms of neighboring water molecules _ Hydrogen bonds are responsible for many of the unique properties of water _ We’ll explore this in more detail in the next module _ Watch the following animation that illustrates hydrogen bonding _ "

_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_quiz_wrapper1,"As you’ve seen, there are many ways that atoms interact with each other and form chemical bonds _ In the next module, we’ll take a closer look at water, which is one of the most biologically important molecules on the planet."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_quiz_wrapper2,"You are almost ready to take the module quiz _ Before proceeding, review the key terms introduced in this module _ When you are ready, check your understanding of this content by taking the quiz linked at the bottom of this page _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_bonding_quiz_wrapper3,"Review the following key terms from this module _ Click on the term to view a definition and any additional information _ When you are ready, check your understanding of chemical bonding by taking the quiz linked below."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water1,"Have you ever wondered why scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? It is because, at least here on Earth, water is essential to life _ Evidence of water on Mars, and some of the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, increases the odds that life may exist there _ Here on Earth, water is one of the most abundant molecules _ The water content of our bodies and our cells ranges from 70 to 95 percent _ All of life’s chemical reactions take place in watery fluid _ Without water, life as we know it simply would not exist."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water2,There are four properties of water that make it such a unique and important molecule:
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water3, Water is an excellent solvent and can dissolve a wide range of substances _ Water is cohesive _ Water’s temperature tends to remain stable _ Solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water4,These properties of water are due to the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules _ Hydrogen bonds are discussed in the Chemical Bonds module _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1,Solutions are homogeneous mixtures _ This means that you can sample any part of the solution and the composition of the solution will be the same.
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b2,Solutions have two components:
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b3, solvent: the component of the solution in the greatest quantity _ solutes: the component(s) present in lower quantities _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b4,"If you add some salt to water, you are making a solution _ Water is the solvent and the salt is the solute _ Solutions can have more than one solute _ If you add sugar to your salt solution, both sugar and salt would be the solutes of the solution _ Solutions in which water is the solvent are called aqueous solutions _ The inside of our cells and our body fluids are examples of aqueous solutions _ When a solute is added to a solvent and a solution is formed; the solute is described as “dissolving” in the solvent."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b5,"Substances that will dissolve in water are hydrophilic or water-loving _ What kinds of molecules are hydrophilic? Ionic substances like table salt (NaCl) are hydrophilic _ They split into positive and negative ions and dissolve in water _ Polar water molecules surround the charged particles, breaking them away and pulling them into the fluid _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b6,"Polar molecules also are hydrophilic _ Polar water molecules readily surround and dissolve polar molecules or molecules with polar functional groups _ Examples include sugars and alcohols, which have hydroxyl groups _ Molecules that do not dissolve in water are hydrophobic (from the Greek word meaning water-fearing or water-hating) _ Nonpolar molecules are hydrophobic _ Examples include hydrocarbons and fatty acids with their abundant nonpolar C-H bonds _ Have you ever tried to mix water and oil? Oils and fats are nonpolar and will not form a solution with water."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b7,"You can often determine whether a substance is hydrophobic or hydrophilic simply by using common knowledge _ Oils and oil-like substances will probably be hydrophobic _ But even if you don’t know anything about a substance except for its chemical structure, you can still figure out whether it is hydrophobic or hydrophilic _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b8,"When looking at a substance’s chemical structure, the key is to figure out whether or not there are any parts of the molecule that “look like water.” If there are, then the unknown chemical will probably dissolve in water _ Go ahead and try it out _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b9,Next we will examine hydrophobic molecules more closely _ Substances with hydrophobic molecules will not dissolve in water and instead will tend to separate from water _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev1,"Some molecules are hydrophobic, which literally means fear (phobia) of water (hydro) _ These molecules do not like to dissolve in water _ When hydrophobic molecules are mixed with water, they will tend to separate into distinct phases (or layers), one containing water and the other containing the hydrophobic molecules _ This makes it very difficult, for example, to “wash” oil off of waterfowl after an oil spill."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev2,"Things composed of hydrophobic molecules generally include oils, fats, and greasy substances _ Materials containing hydrophobic substances are often used for removal of oil from water and management of oil spills _ Other molecules are hydrophilic, which means love (philic) of water, and readily dissolve in water."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev3,"Now that you know some common hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, let’s look at their structures to understand why they interact with water in different ways."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev4,"The additional atoms that are found only on glucose are electronegative, meaning that they will withdraw some of the electrons from the atoms that form bonds with them _ The electronegative atom will have a slight negative charge, and the atom that it is bonded to it will have a slight positive charge _ The unequal distribution of electrons makes the bond a polar bond."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev5,"Lets consider why the polar bonds on hydrophilic molecules interact favorably with water _ Recall that water has the molecular structure of H-O-H, so it also has polar bonds _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev6,"The interaction between a polar bond on water and polar bonds on hydrophilic molecules is given a special name — the hydrogen bond, because it involves a hydrogen that forms a bridge between the two molecules _ Hydrogen bonds are fairly stable, so quite a bit of energy is released when they are formed _ The release of energy helps hydrophilic molecules like glucose dissolve in water _ Since hydrophilic molecules contain polar bonds, they are often referred to as polar molecules _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev7,"Hydrophobic molecules lack the electronegative atoms that are required to generate a polar bond _ Thus, hydrophobic molecules are also referred to as nonpolar."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev8,"The fact that nonpolar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds in one reason why they have low solubility in water; however, there is another far more important force that drives nonpolar molecules from water, called the hydrophobic effect."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev9,"When a non-polar molecule dissolves in water it becomes completely surrounded by water molecules _ The water molecules cannot form hydrogen bond with the non-polar molecule, however they do form hydrogen bonds with the other water molecules that surround the non-polar molecule, forming a layer of hydrogen bonded water molecules that cover, or form a cage, around the dissolved non-polar molecule _ A representation of these water molecules organized around dissolved butane is shown in the following Jmol:"
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev10,"The dissolved butane is highlighted in yellow _ It is surrounded by a cage of water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds (purple) with each other _ Place your cursor over the structure left-click, hold, and move your pointer to rotate the structure _ Right-click to display a pop-up menu and select zoom-in or zoom-out to examine the chemical bonds _ (Source: pdb file modified from Udachin et al., J _ Chem _ Phys, 134, 121104 (2011) _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev11,"The formation of the water cage is unfavorable, because it requires water molecules to become ordered _ Ordering anything requires energy, whether it is a cage of water molecules surrounding a nonpolar molecule, or your messy dorm room _ The energy cost of ordering water molecules around nonpolar compounds is so high that they are forced out of the water, leading to a separation of phases; oil and water don’t mix because of the hydrophobic effect _ Most biological molecules contain both polar and nonpolar regions _ Their behavior in water depends on the relative number and type of polar groups versus nonpolar groups _ For example, consider this series of simple alcohols _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev12,"Molecules that contain a very polar part and a very nonpolar part are called amphipathic _ The polar part interacts with water, forming strong interactions, while the nonpolar part doesn’t interact with water because of the hydrophobic effect _ In order to accomplish this, amphipathic molecules usually undergo spontaneous self-assembly into structures that expose the polar part to water and keep the nonpolar section away from water _ One example of amphipathic molecules are fatty acids _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev13,"The carboxylate group (COOH) on the left interacts strongly with water, while the remaining part of the molecule is very hydrophobic and is forced away from water _ Fatty acids form structures in solution called micelles _ These spherical structures have the hydrophilic part exposed to water on the surface of the sphere and bury the hydrophobic part in the center of the sphere _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_b1_rev14,"You might be wondering why triglycerides are not amphipathic, given that they are similar to fatty acids, with a polar group of atoms and a nonpolar group _ The reason is that the polar region of triglycerides interacts weakly with water because there is no free -OH group."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_c1,"Have you ever filled up a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass _ This water can stay above the edges of the glass because of the property of cohesion _ In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together _ Cohesion allows surface tension, the capacity of a liquid’s surface to resist being ruptured when placed under tension or stress _ When water is sprinkled onto a solid surface, surface tension causes the water to remain in compact droplets instead of spreading out into a thin film."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_c2,"When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet, even though the object is denser (heavier) than the water _ This occurs because of the surface tension that is created by the water molecules _ Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating on the top _ Many insects are specially adapted to exploit surface tension, which allows them to literally “walk on water.”"
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_c3,"These cohesive forces are related to water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules _ This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water _ You will notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle _ This is because the water molecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_c4,"Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life _ For example, because of these forces, water can flow up tubes within plants _ These tubes connect the roots of plants to their leaves, and carry water to plant tissues _ Adhesion helps water cling to the walls of the tubes, and cohesion keeps the water in an intact column _ Without these properties of water, tall plants would be unable to receive the water and nutrients they require, and they would die."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_d1,"Imagine you have placed a metal pan containing water on the stove _ You transfer heat energy to the pan _ If you touch the metal pan after a few minutes, it is warm or even hot to the touch, but the water does not yet feel warm _ The metal’s temperature changes much more quickly than that of the water, even though both substances are receiving heat from the same source _ Temperature is a measure of the vibrational energy of molecules within a substance; it reflects how fast the molecules are jiggling around _ If you add heat to metal, the molecules respond quickly with an increase in their “jiggling” and the temperature increases rapidly _ If you add the same amount of heat to water, the molecules respond much less quickly _ Why is water’s temperature so resistant to change?"
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_d2,"When water is heated, a large part of the heat energy goes into breaking the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules _ Only a small part actually increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules _ Imagine a rack of billiard (pool) balls _ When the cue ball strikes them, energy is transferred and the balls “break,” rolling in every direction _ What would happen if the balls were connected by rubber bands? They would not move nearly as much _ Similarly, the hydrogen bonds among water molecules make it hard to increase their “jiggling.” As heat is added, hydrogen bonds are broken and water warms up, but due to the hydrogen bonding, the water’s temperature changes only slowly _ When water cools down, it releases a great deal of heat as hydrogen bonds are re-established _ This effect is particularly strong when water freezes; water molecules are joined in a regular crystal structure by stable hydrogen bonds _ As these bonds form, heat is released to the surrounding environment _ You may have noticed that snowy days are often not quite as cold as the dry clear days of winter _ This is yet another example of the way that water moderates temperature."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_e1,"When water freezes, the water molecules become arranged into a regular crystal _ Each water molecule is bound by four hydrogen bonds to its neighbors _ In this arrangement, the water molecules are further apart than they are in liquid water _ Thus, the density of ice is less than the density of liquid water _ Ice, the solid state of water, can float in the liquid state _ This is important for lakes and ponds that contain fish and plants _ When the temperature goes below freezing, ice is formed _ The ice is less dense than the liquid, so it floats on the top of the lake or pond _ The surface ice insulates the pond, helping it to retain heat, and keeps the pond from freezing solid _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_e2,"The three dimensional structure of ice is shown above _ Place your cursor over the structure, left-click, hold, and move your pointer to rotate the molecule _ Click on “Highlight Void” to show the empty volume generated due to the hydrogen bonds in ice _ Click on the ""Spin on/off"" checkbox to automatically spin or stop spinning the molecule _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_e3,"Solid water is less dense than liquid water because in ice, the regular pattern of hydrogen bonds pushes the molecules further apart."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_soaps_v11,"We use detergents to remove oily dirt from things _ We use dish detergent to remove the grease on dishes, laundry detergent for oils on our clothes, and shampoo for oils in our hair _ Detergents make the hydrophobic oils soluble so that the dirt can be rinsed away _ How does this happen?"
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_soaps_v12,"All detergents are amphipathic molecules; they have a polar, water-loving (hydrophilic) part and a nonpolar, water-hating (hydrophobic) part, which allows them to dissolve in both water and oils _ The chemical structure of a common detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), is shown below _ The hydrophilic part of DS interacts favorably with water by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic (charge-charge) interactions between the negative charge on the DS and the partial positive charges on the polar water molecules _ The hydrophobic part has no polar atoms to form favorable interactions with the water."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_soaps_v13,"When placed in water, detergents spontaneously form organized spherical structures called micelles _ In a micelle, the hydrophilic part of the detergent is on the surface of the sphere and interacts with the water _ The center of the sphere contains the hydrophobic part of the detergent, hidden from the water _ A cross section image and a three-dimensional structure of a micelle are shown below _ When a micelle comes in contact with oily (hydrophobic) compounds, the oils dissolve into the interior of the micelle and can be washed away with the micelle."
_u810_BioChemistry,biochem_water_soaps_v14,"A cross section of a micelle is shown on the left _ The white balls represent the hydrophilic part of the molecule; the yellow strings represent the hydrophobic part of the detergent _ The Jmol on the right shows a micelle dissolved in water _ You can remove the water to see the micelle by clicking on the ""Water Removal"" checkbox _ Automatically rotate the molecule by clicking on the ""Spin on"" checkbox _ "

_u810_BioChemistry,a-g-h2o-intro1,"Upon completing this module, students will be able to: "
_u810_BioChemistry,a-g-h2o-intro2," Biological systems use only a small subset of the elements (approximately 10 %) found in the periodic table _ The chemical reactions that take place in cells represent only a small subset of all possible reactions _ Before we begin an in-depth study of other aspects of molecular and cellular biology, one needs to understand the restrictions the cellular environment places on the possible chemical reactions and the resulting structures _ By learning about the characteristics of the subset atoms, and a limited set of functional groups found in biological molecules, you will be able to identify, and predict many of the reactions that can take place, understand and predict the physical properties of the molecules made by these reactions, and develop an understanding of why a process occurs as it does in a cell _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,a-g-h2o-intro3," We start with an understanding that the cellular environment is essentially aqueous (water) based, and thus, we will begin with a discussion of the chemistry of water as it relates to bonding, pH and temperature control _ The first two concepts (bonding and pH) dictate why molecules are soluble in the cell, in what part of the cell they are soluble, what charge molecules will carry and how that charge is controlled by pH _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,a-g-h2o-intro4," In the next few pages, we discuss each of the 10 learning objectives described in the objective link (check mark icon at the top and bottom of each page) _ Each subsequent page will list the specific objectives relevant to that page _ Many of the simulations and demonstrations, used in this module, are referenced in the Glossary Module _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables1,"After examing atoms and their properties, students will be able to:"
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables2," The key biologically relevant elements are hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S) _ These elements represent over 95% of the mass of a cell _ Carbon is a major component of nearly all biological molecules _ Some elements are found in relatively small amounts and are called “trace elements.” The examples include sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn) _ Throughout the course you will see how atoms of these elements are very important to the functioning of a cell _ Living organisms get the required elements from outside and constantly rearrange these elements to build their own molecules _ Thus, understanding behavior and structure of elements is important for understanding life _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables3,"Elements are characterized by their atomic structure _ While the subatomic structure of the atom is a major topic of interest in chemistry, physics and biophysics, the basic structure described below provides sufficient information for the construction of molecules in the context of this course _ Atoms are made up of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons _ Protons and neutrons are at the center of the atom and have a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (a.m.u) each _ Each proton has a positive charge (+1), while neutrons are neutral (they carry no charge) _ Each electron has a negative charge (-1) and zero mass _ Two atoms that differ by the number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element (e.g _ radioactive isotope of iodine is used for cancer treatment) _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables4,"These elements represent over 95% of the mass of a cell _ Carbon is a major component of nearly all biological molecules _ Elements are characterized by their atomic structure _ While the subatomic structure of the atom is a major topic of interest in chemistry, physics and biophysics, the basic structure described below provides sufficient information for the construction of molecules in the context of this course _ Atomic mass, the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic structure, is a particularly useful measure of each element _ By summing the atomic mass of all the atoms in a molecule, one can estimate the molecular mass of the molecule, which is then expressed in atomic mass units or Daltons _ The masses of the six atoms of the elements listed above are given in the following Atomic Properties TABLE _ The masses can be found in the upper right hand corner of the box for each element in the periodic table _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables5,One characteristic of the atoms of the major elements is that they are able to form molecules through formation of covalent bonds with other atoms _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables6,Covalent bonds represent the sharing of the electrons (negatively charged subatomic particles between atoms.) The number of covalent bonds that can form is dictated by the number of unpaired electrons in the outer valence shell of the atom.

_u810_BioChemistry,atoms_overview_no_tables12,"As you can see in the table, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur are electronegative atoms and represent the major electronegative atoms in biological molecules _ Phosphorous, an important component in nucleic acids (e.g _ DNA) is also electronegative _ Water is a good example of how the very electronegative atom of oxygen influences the electrons shared with hydrogen _ Oxygen has six valence electrons; two sets of paired electrons and two sets of single bonding electrons _ The shared electron pair of each oxygen-hydrogen covalent bond, illustrated below, spends more time associated with the oxygen atom than the hydrogen atom _ This results in the oxygen being partially negative, and the hydrogen partially positive, as indicated in the figure below by δ- and δ+ _ These are then described as a polar covalent bonds _ The presence of polar covalent bonds in water and in other molecules containing electronegative atoms puts these molecules in a family of molecules referred to as being polar _ We will return to polar bonds in water and their consequences in the ""Importance of Water"" section _ Oxygen is not the only electronegative element that forms polar bonds, as long as the electronegativities of the two atoms differ, the bond will have some degree of polar character _ For example, the P-O bond in DNA is polar, with the phosphorous having a partial positive charge since it is less electronegative than oxygen."

_u810_BioChemistry,water_wbk7,Answering questions like the one above is good practice for answering the kinds of questions that may appear on the exams _ Your answers may also shape discussions in class _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk1,"Upon investigation of bonding, students should distinguish hydrogen bonds from chemical bonds and be able to:"
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk2," Three major types of chemical bonding have been described thus far: covalent bonding, and two forms of non-covalent bonding, ionic and hydrogen _ These bonds are all important in the functioning of a cell _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk3," Covalent bonds are the strongest _ One atom fully shares one, two or three electrons with another atom., forming a single, double, or triple bond, respectively _ The bonds can be between the same element (e.g., C-C bonds) or between different elements (e.g., C-O, C-N, H-O) _ The nature of the covalent bond is determined by the number of electrons shared and the nature of the two elements attached."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk4,Single bonds: Two atoms attached by a single covalent bond have free rotation about the bond.
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk5,"Double bonds: Two carbons attached by a double covalent bond can only undergo 180 degree rotations and the atoms bound to these carbons are constrained to lie in the same plane as the carbon atom. _ Rotation about the carbon-carbon bond has structural implications for molecules in which they are found _ For example, the type of bond can influence the fluidity of biological membranes and restrict the folding of proteins."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk6,"Triple bonds _ Although carbon can form triple bonds, such as in the compound acetylene (HCCH), triple bonds are not found in biological systems."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk7,Aromatic Compounds: Involve the sharing of electrons between atoms that form a ring _ The shared electrons form a partial (1/2) double bond between each atom in the ring structure _ Aromatic compounds have unique geometrical properties and absorb ultraviolet light .
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk8," Covalent bonds involving electronegative atoms often result in polar molecules _ As discussed earlier, the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water are polar, due to the fact that oxygen is electron withdrawing and hydrogen is willing to give up its lone electron _ The double bond between carbon and oxygen atoms in a carbonyl group is polar, for the same reason that the oxygen attracts the electrons to itself _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk9,"The overall shape of molecules depends on the geometry of the bonds that are formed between atoms _ The shape of a molecule can have a large effect on its biological activity, often small changes in the shape of a molecule will make it biologically inactive."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk10,"We saw with water that the orientation of atoms around the oxygen was tetrahydral with the angle between the two hydrogen atoms close what would be expected for a tetrahydral shape _ Both carbon and nitrogen also form tetrahydral shapes _ In the case of methane the four hydrogen atoms are at the corners of a tetrahydron _ In ammonia, the three attached hydrogens form the base of a tetrahydron _ In the ammonium ion, the addition of a fourth hydrogen, to form NH4+, places the fourth hydrogen at the last unoccupied corner of the tetrahydron."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk11,"Carbon and nitrogen can also form planer geometries, where all of the atoms that are bound to the carbon (or nitrogen) are in the same plane as the carbon or nitrogen _ In the case of carbon, a planer geometry is usually observed if the carbon is involved in a double bond, while the tetrahydral geometry is found if the carbon is forming single bonds _ Compare the structure of methanol to formaldhyde in the Jmol below _ In methanol, carbon forms four single bonds while in formaldehyde there is a double bond between the carbon and the oxygen _ The carbon atom in methanol shows tetrahdyral geometry, while the carbon atom in formaldehdye is planer; the two hydrogens and oxygen lie in the same plane as the carbon."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk12,Instructions: Compare the geometries of carbon atom in methanol and formaldhyde and then answer the questions below.
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk13," An important aspect of carbon bonding is the fact that carbon can covalently bond to four groups and that the bonding geometry of the carbon atom is tetrahedral _ Therefore, if the four groups attached to the carbon are different, then two unique arrangements of the groups around the carbon atom are possible and this carbon is said to be an asymmetric center or a chiral center _ The two arrangements of groups about the carbon are mirror images of each other and these two structures are referred to as enantiomers _ It is impossible to superimpose these two mirror images, consequently they are distinct molecules."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk14,"Because the enantiomers have identical functional groups attached to the chiral center they have identical physical and chemical properties - except for the direction they rotate plane polarized light _ Experimentally, the enantiomers are distinguished by the direction of rotation of plane polarized light _ The enantiomer that rotates light to the right is designated as D (dextro) form of the compound _ The other enantiomer will rotate light in the opposite direction, and is designated as the L (levulo) form of the compound."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk15,"The example shown below is the three carbon carbohydrate, glyceraldehyde _ This compound contains a chiral center at the middle, or second carbon, because that carbon has four different groups attached to it _ The configuration of atoms in the left-hand structure causes polarized light to be rotated to the right and is therefore the D form _ Its mirror image shown on the right, rotates polarized light in the opposite direction, and is therefore the L form _ Note that in both compounds the H and OH groups project out of the page towards you, but in the D form the -OH group is to the right of carbon two while in the L-form it points to the left."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk16,"While enantiomers usually undergo chemical reactions in an identical fashion, biological systems are capable of discriminating between these structurally different molecules because biological systems themselves contain chiral centers, such as in amino acids _ The ability to discriminate between the enantiomers is an example of bioselectivity _ The chemical world has been narrowed by the selective use of specific enantiomers (in this case only D-glyceraldehyde) by biological systems."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk17,"When identical groups attached to a carbon are arranged in multiple ways such that two of the resulting structures are non-superimposable, they are mirror images of each other."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk18,Instructions: Chloro-fluoro methane and its mirror image are shown below _ Please answer the question using these two structures.
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk19,Instructions: One additional hydrogen has been replaced by bromine (colored purple) _ One form of the molecule is shown on the left and it's mirror image is on the right _ Use these two structures to answer the question on the right.
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk20,"Instructions: Try to determine the chirality of glyceraldehyde, one ot the simplest organic molecules found in biology _ A static image of L-glyceraldehyde is shown on the left _ Is the right 3D structure the D form or the L form of glyceraldehyde?"
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk21,"Instructions: Try to identify the chiral center(s) of a more complicated molecule - the amino acid threonine, one of the building blocks of proteins."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk23,"Ionic bonds form between oppositely charged atoms _ No electron sharing or transfer occurs _ The atoms are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges _ For example, the positive Na ion, and negatively charged Cl ion, are attracted to each other and form table salt _ In an aqueous solution, these ions are completely dissociated and are defined as strong electrolytes _ In water molecules surround the ions to form polar interactions to satisfy the charges on the ions _ Thus the ions become encapsulated by water spheres, which are called spheres of hydration _ The biological world is very ionic and the spheres of hydration are important in a cell because they maintain the separation of the many ions of the cell from each other _ The sphere of hydration must be broken in order for binding to take place with a specific binding partner _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk24," Previously, water was described as having a high dielectric constant _ This property that is a measure of the polarity of the covalent bond within the molecule accounts for the separation of ions by polar molecules such as water _ The force of attraction between two oppositely charged ions is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant _ Thus water with a high dielectric constant decreases the attraction between opposite charges _ This is physically explained by the ability of polar solvents to form ordered hydration layers around ions."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk26,"Hydrogen bonding was covered in Water -- Hydrogen Bonding (go there now.) Remember that hydrogen bonding occurs between partially negatively charged electronegative atoms, and partially positively charged hydrogen atoms that are attached to electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur _ Hydrogen bonding is a critical bonding in the cell _ It is the principal bonding that holds the tertiary structure of proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids together and the overall stability of these molecules is due in part to the cumulative effect of the large number of hydrogen bonds found in the functional structures _ Hydrogen bonds are found in and between a variety of molecules _ For example, the enormous number of hydrogen bonds between strands of cellulose provide the strength and structure of the plant cell wall _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk27,"The nature of polar molecules is that they contain electronegative atoms, consequently they are capable of hydrogen bonding with aqueous or polar solvents _ Because polar molecules are generally water soluble, they are referred to as being hydrophilic, or water-loving _ The one-carbon alcohol, methanol, is an example of a polar molecule _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk28," The final type of interaction occurs between neutral, hydrophobic , or water-fearing, molecules _ These molecules do not interact with water and are characterized by a complete lack of electronegative atoms _ In aqueous solutions the hydrophobic molecules are driven together to the exclusion of water _ For example, shaking a bottle of oil and vinegar (acetic acid in water), such as in a salad dressing, results in the oil being dispersed as tiny droplets in the vinegar _ As the mixture settles, the oil collects in larger and larger drops until it only exists as a layer, or phase, above the vinegar."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk29,"A similar effect occurs in biological systems _ As a protein folds to its final three-dimensional structure, the hydrophobic parts of the protein are forced together and away from the aqueous environment of the cell _ Similarly, biological membranes are stabilized by the exclusion of water between layers of lipids as we will see later."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk30," The hydrophobic effect does not involve direct bonding between the non-polar molecules, it is an entropy driven process _ You may recall that processes that increase the disorder of a system are more favorable _ When a hydrophobic molecule is truly dissolved in water, the water forms a highly ordered ice-like shell around the compound _ When the hydrophobic molecules contact each during separation of the aqueous and non-polar phases, the ordered water is released and become highly disordered _ The increase in disorder of the released water molecules is responsible for the spontaneous assembly of many biological systems, such as proteins and membranes."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk31,"Mixed Non-polar/polar molecules: Of course, there are instances where even molecules with electronegative atoms will not be water soluble _ Computer algorithms are currently used to predict water solubility based on structure _ For our purposes, we will balance the ratio of polar and non-polar elements in a structure to estimate the chemical nature of any compound we are going to study _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk32,"Amphipathic molecules are molecules that have a distinct non-polar, or hydrophobic region, and a distinct polar region _ These molecules do not form true solution is water _ Rather, the non-polar parts are forced together into a non-polar aggregate, leaving the polar part of the molecule to interact with the aqueous phase _ Detergents and long-chain carboxylic acids are examples of amphipathic molecules."
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk33,"An important force in biochemistry is due to van der Waals interactions _ This interaction occurs between any two surfaces that are in contact _ The force is actually an electrostatic one that occurs as a result of a momentary fluctuation in the charge on one surface. _ This charge causes the other surface to momentarily assume the opposite charge, leading to a net attractive force _ If one of the surfaces has a permanent dipole, due to the presence of electronegative or electropositive atoms, then the attraction is stronger _ The strength of van der Waals forces depend on the contact surface area; the larger the area the larger the interaction _ At the molecular level, van der Waals interactions can contribute 10s of kJ/mol of energy _ At the macroscopic level van der Waals forces can become quite large _ For example, the common gecko generates sufficient van der Waals forces due to the large surface area of its foot pads to walk on the ceiling!"
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk34," Each of the bond types represents a measurable amount of energy _ To break a bond, the equivalent amount of energy must be expended _ In metabolism, bonds are broken in molecules, such as glucose, to ""release"" the energy _ The cell utilizes this energy to drive other energy consuming reactions _ The covalent bond has the most energy associated with it, on average approximately 100 kilocalories/mole (kcal/mol) _ The non-covalent bonds, ionic and hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions, have approximately 5 kcals/mol associated with each of them _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk35, It should be noted here that throughout the presentation of this course approximations will be used for certain values so that estimations can be made as we move to more complex systems _ It is to be acknowledged that very precise values for each of the measurements are not available _ 
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk36," Thus the non-covalent bonds that have been introduced have approximately 20 times less energy associated with them and, thus, are more easily broken individually _ However, hydrogen bonds generally form extensive networks, and the total energy associated with the network is the sum of the individual interactions _ As anyone who has done a ""belly buster"" knows, breaking a large surface area of water is extremely difficult (and painful!) _ "
_u810_BioChemistry,bonding_wbk37," When NaCl dissolves in water, each atom becomes surrounded by at least 20 water molecules _ As NaCl there is 5 kcal/mol of energy associated with the ionic attraction of the cation and anion, but when a Na ion is surrounded by 20 water molecules, there is 100 kcal/mol of energy associated with just the Na ion _ Thus, NaCl in an aqueous solution is energetically more favored than NaCl as the ionically bonded molecule due to the resulting hydrated state _ You will explore what happens to molecules that only partially dissociate, or weak electrolytes, in water in the next module _ "

_u810_BioChemistry,definitions_index15,"The term “hydrophobic interactions” is used to describe the force driving the exclusion of nonpolar molecules from aqueous environment _ In contrast to other non-covalent interactions, there is NO strong attractive force bringing nonpolar molecules together _ Water molecules have stronger attraction for other water molecules than for non-polar molecules _ As a result, water molecules tend to bond to each other (via hydrogen bonds) excluding nonpolar molecules _ Non-polar molecules do interact with each other via van der Waals bonds, but these week interactions cannot be considered the driving force for exclusion of non-polar molecules from water _ Deeper understanding of hydrophobic interactions requires familiarity with concepts of thermodynamics (entropy)."

redox,pathways3,"Synthetic, or anabolic, pathways generally consume energy _ They usually consist of an initial linear segment, followed by branching to complex compounds at the end of the pathway _ This strategy allows the use of common simple starting materials for the synthesis of a number of complex molecules."
redox,pathways4,Common features of all metabolic pathways are:
redox,pathways5," They contain multiple intermediates (e.g _ compounds A, B, C, .), with small molecular differences between the intermediates _ Each step, or conversion between intermediates, is catalyzed by an enzyme (e.g _ E1) _ The pathway is regulated to optimize the use of resources _ "
redox,pathways6,"It is possible to reverse the direction of a metabolic pathways, depending on the needs of the organisms; a degradative pathway can become a synthetic one _ Many of the enzymes that catalyze reactions in one direction can be easily reversed, and thus function in both pathways _ A small number of steps utilize different enzymes in the forward versus the reverse direction _ These enzymes are regulated in a coordinated fashion such that a pathway operates in only direction at time."
redox,pathways7,Pathways can be:
redox,regulation1,"By the end of this module, students should be able to:"
redox,regulation2,"It is essential that biochemical pathways are regulated, otherwise the cell would waste resources _ Some general properties associated with the regulation of metabolic pathways are listed below"
redox,regulation3," At least one step is regulated, often in multiple ways _ Essentially irreversible steps, i.e _ those with large energy changes, are regulated _ Consequently, once the pathway is turned on, metabolites that enter the pathway are committed to complete the pathway _ In synthetic and degradative pathways a common step is performed by different enzymes, each of which are regulated in a coordinated fashion such that only one pathway is on at a time _ "
redox,regulation4,"There are five general methods by which the flux through a step in the pathway can be regulated _ These methods differ in how rapidly they can respond to changes in the environment _ Each of these methods is discussed below, with the more rapid form of regulation at the top of the list _ "
redox,regulation5," Substrate availability _ For many enzymes, the intracellular level of substrate is below the level that half saturates the enzyme _ Therefore, if the substrate concentration increases the rate of the reaction will increase due to the formation of additional enzyme-substrate complexes _ If the substrate concentration is very low, the increase in the rate of the reaction is almost equal to the increase in substrate concentration _ Product inhibition _ In this case the product of the reaction inhibits the enzyme that generated it, preventing the accumulation of intermediates in a pathway _ The product is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme that just created it _ "
redox,regulation6," Feedback inhibitors.In this case, a compound that is further down the pathway, or even a compound in a separate pathway, will inhibit a reaction _ Again, this prevents an accumulation of intermediates in a pathway _ The binding of the feedback inhibitor usually causes a change in the shape of the enzyme; a feedback inhibitor is an example of a non-competitive inhibitor or an allosteric inhibitor _ Allosteric Pathway "
redox,regulation7,Allosteric binding causes conformational changes in an enzyme that can either inhibit or activate the enzyme _ 
redox,regulation8,"Enzyme phosphorylation _ The addition of phosphate groups to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues on enzymes can cause a change in the shape of the active site of the enzyme _ This change in shape is an allosteric effect _ The change may lead to a more active enzyme (allosteric activator) or a less active enzyme (an allosteric inhibitor) _ Enzyme levels _ Recall that the rate of product formation is proportional to the amount of enzyme _ Enzyme levels can be increased by the conversion of inactive forms of the enzyme to active forms _ This form of regulation occurs with digestive enzymes _ These are made in an inactive form in the pancreas, but activated by cleavage in the small intestine _ The levels of enzyme can also be varied by regulating the synthesis of the enzyme _ This method of regulation is common during development, when certain enzymes are only present during defined developmental stages _ "
redox,regulation9, The following quiz will be graded and recorded in the grade book _ You may take this quiz only once.
redox,redox1,"By the end of this module, students should be able to:"
redox,redox2,"Oxidation-reduction reactions, or Redox reactions are common in metabolic pathways _ Generally, degradative (catabolic) pathways cause the net oxidation of compounds, releasing energy _ In contrast, synthetic (anabolilc) pathways, are generally reductive pathways _ "
redox,redox3,Oxidations involve the loss of electrons.
redox,redox4,Reductions involve the gain of electrons.
redox,redox5,Here are two mnemonics to help you remember where the electrons go during redox reactions:
redox,redox6," LEO GER: ""leo [the lion] goes grr"" _ Lose electrons oxidation, gain electron reduction _ OIL RIG: Oxidation involves loss, reduction involves gain _ "
redox,redox7,"An example of an oxidation is the conversion of iron from its metallic state, Fe0, to its rusted form, Fe+3, by the loss of three electrons."
redox,redox8,"The above reaction is an incomplete description of a redox reaction because it does not indicate the fate of the electrons that were obtained from iron _ Since free electrons generally cannot exist, all oxidation reactions must be coupled to a corresponding reduction _ Since the above reaction only describes one-half of the reaction it is referred to as a half-reaction _ The oxidation of iron could be coupled to the reduction of copper ions, which is described by the following half-reaction:"
redox,redox9,"The complete reaction, balanced such that there are no free electrons, is:"
redox,redox10,The pair of compounds that exchange electrons are often referred to as a redox couple.
redox,redox11," In most biochemical redox reactions a total of two electrons are transferred _ These electrons are often transferred as hydrogen atoms, containing a proton and electron _ Two common electron acceptors are NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) _ They both can accept two electrons, giving the reduced forms NADH and FADH2, respectively _ The structure of the oxidized forms of these compounds are shown below."
redox,redox12,Oxidation of NAD+ _ In the oxidation of glyceraldehyde to phosphoglycerate an aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylic acid and the released electrons are placed on to NAD+ to form NADH.
redox,redox13,"Oxidation of FAD _ The oxidation of succinate to fumarate, using FAD as an electron acceptor is another example of a redox reaction found in a metabolic pathway _ Two hydrogen atoms (= two electron plus two protons) are removed from succinate and placed on FAD, producing fumarate and FADH2, oxidizing a carbon-carbon single bond to a double bond."
redox,redox14,"It is often difficult to determine from the structure of an organic compound whether it has been oxidized or reduced in a reaction _ For example, the addition of a water molecule to an double bond (alkene) appears to be a redox reaction because an -OH group has been added ."
redox,redox15,The rules for balancing redox reactions are as follows:
redox,redox16," Make the number of oxygen atoms in the reactant and product equal by adding the appropriate number of water molecules to one side of the reaction or the other _ Use H+, or H+ + e-, or e- to balance hydrogen atoms and/or charge _ A redox reaction has occurred if electrons are consumed or released "
redox,redox17,"The above reaction is balanced as is, and is therefore not a redox reaction."
redox,redox18,Try the following mini-tutor to test your skill at assessing whether a redox reaction has occurred.
redox,energetics1, The operation of a metabolic pathway produces (catabolic) or consumes (anabolic) energy _ There are a number of different forms of energy storage that are found in metabolic pathways _ These include:
redox,energetics2," Phosphorylated Compounds Nucleoside triphosphates, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are commonly used to store energy _ The addition of an inorganic phosphate group to a nucleotide diphosphate to form the triphosphate requires approximately 30 kJ/mol of energy _ The reaction showing the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate is pictured below _ Phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) _ This reaction requires the input of approximately 30 kJ/mol _ Formation of ATP occurs when the negatively charged phosphate group on ADP attacks the electropositive phosphate in inorganic phosphate, forming a phosphate anhydride bond with the release of water (red arrow) _ ATP can be used to phosphorylate other nucleoside diphosphates with essentially no input of energy, for example: The myth of high-energy phosphate bonds _ When a phosphate is released from ATP to form ADP, about 30 kJ/mol of energy is released _ It is often stated, incorrectly, that the bond that is broken is ""high-energy"" _ In fact, its energy is no different than any other phosphate bond of the same type _ The release of energy is due to the fact that the products, ADP and inorganic phosphate, are lower in energy than ATP by 30 kJ/mol _ One reason that ATP is higher in energy is due to charge repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate groups _ Once the phosphate group is removed, the unfavorable repulsion disappears _ Reduced redox carriers.The oxidation of metabolytes usually produces energy, If this energy was not captured in some way, it would be lost as heat _ The reduced form of redox carriers, such as NADH and FADH2, are higher in energy than their corresponding oxidized forms, capturing the energy that would otherwise be lost as heat _ For example, the oxidation of isocitrate to ketoglutarate releases approximately 70 kJ/mol, 60 of which is captured by converting NAD+ to NADH _ High energy thioesters are often produced by oxidative steps _ For example, the energy released by the oxidation of an aldehyde is stored in both the reduced form of NAD+ as well in a thioester _ The hydrolysis of the thioester can be used to synthesize nucleoside triphosphates or to facilitate the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, as shown below _ The oxidation of the aldehyde to the thioester is highlighted in green _ CoA is coenzyme A, a nucleotide containing cofactor that is an essential co-substrate for many reactions _ Part of the energy of this oxidation, 60 kJ/mol, is captured by the formation of NADH _ The energy stored in the thioester can be used to either phosphorylate GDP to form GTP, capturing another 30 kJ/mol _ In the case of acetyl-CoA (lower diagram) the thioester facilitates the attachment of the acetyl group to oxaloacetate to form citrate, the first compound in the TCA cycle _ Proton gradient The transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen to form water during the electron transport chain, provides energy for the pumping of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane _ This is equivalent to pumping water up hill to fill a reservoir _ As the protons flow back through the membrane, the energy released is used to generate ATP, in much the same way water generates electricity in a hydroelectric plant _ "
redox,thermo1,"Pathways accomplish the net conversion of the starting compounds to the final product of the pathway _ During the normal operation of a pathway there is a constant flux of material through the pathway in one direction _ Note that many pathways are reversible and operate in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the needs of the organism _ The direction of a pathway depends on the energy difference between the starting compounds and final product of the pathway _ The pathway will be spontaneous in the direction that causes a decrease in the free energy of the system _ Reversing the direction of a pathway requires changing the relative energies of the reactants and products"
redox,thermo2," It is useful to have a quantitative way to predict the direction of a pathway given the current environment in the cell _ A method of predicting the direction of a reaction was devised by J _ Willard Gibbs in 1876 and the quantitative parameter that can be used to predict the direction of a reaction is called the Gibbs free energy _ This method is particularly useful because it can be applied to reactions that are not at equilibrium, which is the situation encountered during metabolism _ Before we can discuss the Gibbs free energy, we have to discuss standard energies and their relationship to equilibrium positions of reactions _ Keep in mind that these discussions relate to the thermodynamic properties of pathways, more specifically the relative energy differences between reactants and products under cellular conditions _ The presence of enzymes simply increases the rate of conversion from reactants to products, the enzyme cannot alter the relative energies of these compounds _ "
redox,thermo3,"Consider the simple reaction [A] to [B] _ If we start with a system that is pure [A] it will spontaneously form some [B] until equilibrium is reached _ When a system is at equilibrium, the concentration of products and reactants are constant and it is possible to write an equilibrium constant for the reaction:"
redox,thermo4,"where, KEQ is:"
redox,thermo5,Note that [A] and [B] are at their equilibrium concentrations in this formula.
redox,thermo6,"The standard energy change is the energy change when one mole of reactant is converted to one mole of product, it is the energy difference between reactants and products: Go=Gproductso-Greactantso _ The standard energy change defines the equilibrium position of a reaction through the following equation:"
redox,thermo7, or 
redox,thermo8," For the simple reaction of A to B, the fraction of the system in state [A] is:"
redox,thermo9," In a similar fashion, the fraction in state [B] is:"
redox,thermo10," You can see from the above equations that if the energy of the products are equal to the reactants, then the equilibrium concentration of [B] will be equal to [A] _ Mathematically, this can be shown as follows:"
redox,thermo11,"If the energy of [B] is equal to [A], then Go = 0 _ Therefore"
redox,thermo12,"KEQ=1, and"
redox,thermo13,fA=1/(1+1) = 0.5 and fB=1/(1+1) = 0.5
redox,thermo14,The formula for change in the Gibbs free energy in the reaction for the reaction direction [A] to [B] is: 
redox,thermo15,"Note that in this equation, the concentration of [A] and [B] are not necessarily at their equilibrium concentrations."
redox,thermo16,It can be shown that:
redox,thermo17," If G less than 0 then the reaction is not at equilibrium and will proceed spontaneously in the forward direction, A to B _ If G greater than 0 then the reaction is also not at equilibrium, but will proceed spontaneously in the reverse direction, B to A _ If G=0 the reaction is at equilibrium and the concentrations of reactants and products will not change _ "
redox,thermo18,You can explore these relationships in the following tutorial.
redox,thermo19,"In addition to predicting the direction of the reaction, the absolute value of G, | G |, is the amount of energy released when the concentrations of reactants and products change from their non-equilibrium values to their equilibrium values."
redox,coupling1,"By the end of this module, students should be able to:"
redox,coupling2,"A reaction will be spontaneous in the forward direction if the Gibbs free energy for that reaction is less than zero _ The same reaction, if run in the reverse direction, will have a positive Gibbs free energy and will therefore be non-spontaneous _ If it is necessary to reverse the direction of this reaction to reverse the direction of the pathway, then the sign of the GIbbs free energy for the reverse reaction has to become negative _ If you recall, the Gibbs free energy:"
redox,coupling3,"consists of two parts, the standard energy change, Go, and a term that accounts for the non-equilibrium concentrations of [A] and [B] _ Consequently, an unfavorable reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy can be made spontaneous by making the sum of these two terms negative by coupling the unfavorable reaction to a favorable, energy releasing one _ The energy releasing reaction provides the necessary energy to change the sign of the Gibbs free energy from positive to negative."
redox,coupling4,"There are two forms of coupling, both may be used to ensure a negative Gibbs free energy, direct and indirect coupling _ Direct coupling reduces the standard free energy while indirect coupling reduces the second term of the equation _ Both of these methods are described in more detail below."
redox,coupling5," Direct coupling In this case a large negative Go for the reaction is created by directly coupling the unfavorable reaction to a favorable one on the same enzyme _ For example, the phosphorylation of glucose is very unfavorable if inorganic phosphate is used as the source of phosphate _ The standard energy change of +14 kJ/mol makes the Gibbs energy positive _ However, if the unfavorable reaction is coupled to the conversion of ATP to ADP within the active site of the enzyme hexose kinase the 30 kJ of energy released from ATP can be utilized to reduce the standard energy change such that the overall Gibbs free energy becomes negative _ The overall reaction is the transfer of phosphate from ATP to glucose, with an overall standard energy change of approximately -15 kJ/mol _ Direct coupling: Reaction 1 and 2 are hypothetical half-reactions that sum to give the complete reaction at the bottom of the image _ In the actual reaction the enzyme glucose kinase transfers the phospate group directly from ATP to glucose; hydrolysis of the ATP does not occur _ Note that the two half-reactions sum to give the complete reaction, both in terms of the compounds involved as well as the overall standard energy change _ Indirect coupling _ The Gibbs free energy can also become negative by either having a favorable reaction that preceeds the unfavorable one, or a favorable reaction that follows the unfavorable one _ In the first case, the favorable preceeding reaction causes the concentration of the substrates for the following unfavorable reaction to be higher than equilibrium, making G negative _ For the case of a favorable following reaction, the concentration of the products of the unfavorable reaction are kept to a level that is smaller than the equilibrium concentration, again making G negative _ This type of coupling between reactions is referred to as indirect coupling because the coupling between favorable and unfavorable reactions occurs indirectly, via alteration of concentrations of reactants and products _ Indirect coupling: In the absence of coupling (left) the conversion of [B] to [C] is uphill energetically, and therefore not favorable _ If the preceeding step ([A] to [B]) is very favorable, the concentration of [B] increases to a level above its equilibrium level, which decreases the Gibbs free energy for step [B] to [C] _ Alternatively, if the following step ([C] to [D]) is favorable, the concentration of [C] will be lower than its equilbrium level, which also decreases the Gibbs free energy for the step [B] to [C] _ "
redox,coupling6, The following quiz will be graded and recorded in the grade book _ You may take this quiz only once.
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs1,"Carbohydrates are organic molecules that consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in a 1:2:1 ratio _ The most abundant class of macromolecules found in living systems, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy in living systems _ Large complex carbohydrates can be used to store energy _ For example, a potato is full of starch, which is a complex carbohydrate that the potato plant uses to store energy _ When you eat the complex carbohydrate, your body breaks the large molecules into their smaller subunits (sugars), which you will then use to fuel your own body’s energy needs."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs2,"Carbohydrates can also be used as structural building materials _ Cellulose is an example of a complex carbohydrate used in plants for structural support _ Within plant cell walls, cellulose molecules form chains that provide high tensile strength _ In some plants, cellulose is also included in a secondary cell wall, which adds rigidity and waterproofing _ This helps tree bark, plant leaf stalks, and other structures resist wind and other physical forces in the environment."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs3,"Cellulose, while indigestible to humans, is an important part of our diets because it makes up dietary fiber, which has been linked to lowered risk of diabetes and heart disease _ In this module, you will take a closer look at the structure and function of these important macromolecules."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs4,"The paper you write on, the bowl of cereal you eat for breakfast, and the energy you use to walk up a flight of stairs all come from carbohydrates _ Rice, wheat, and corn are some of humanity’s most important crops; these foods are the primary source of energy for much of our population _ All three of these foods are high in carbohydrates."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs5,"A carbohydrate is an organic molecule that contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen _ Carbohydrates are either simple (often referred to as sugars) or complex _ Simple carbohydrates (sugars) are made up of only one or two sugar monomers _ Each monomer has the proportion of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:1, or CH2O _ You can see why these compounds are called carbohydrates; in a monomer, each carbon is “hydrated.” Complex carbohydrates are made up of more than two sugar monomers covalently bonded together _ Carbohydrates can be further subclassified, again on the basis of structure, depending on the number of monomers in each molecule: monosaccharides and disaccharides (simple carbohydrates) and polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates) _ The table below summarizes the charateristics of carbohydrates based on their size and number of sugar molecule subunits."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs6,"Simple carbohydrates are quickly and easily accessed to generate energy the cell can use, while complex carbohydrates are used to store energy for a longer period of time _ Some complex carbohydrates are also used as structural components _ Carbohydrates also play a role in cell signaling and recognition within multicellular organisms."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b1,"Monosaccharides are the simplest sugars _ The root “mono” means ""one,"" and “saccharide” refers to an organic molecule where the ratio of carbon:hydrogen:oxygen is 1:2:1 (i.e., CNH2NON) _ The more common monosaccharides contain six carbons and have a molecular formula of C6H12O6 _ Glucose, fructose (fruit sugar), and galactose are examples of six-carbon monosaccharides _ A common five-carbon monosaccharide is ribose (the sugar component of RNA), which has a molecular formula of C5H10O5 _ DNA contains a modified ribose where one of the oxygen atoms has been removed, hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid _ Shorter monosaccharides exist as linear molecules while five- and six-carbon monosaccharides form ring-like structures."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b2,"Disaccharides are made of two monosaccharides linked together by a covalent bond (the root “di” means ""two"")."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b3, glucose + fructose = sucrose (table sugar) glucose + galactose = lactose (milk sugar) 
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b4,"Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides (“poly” means ""many"")."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b5,"Glycogen, starch (amylose and amylopectin), and cellulose are all made of many linked glucose monomers _ Glycogen is mainly used for energy storage in animals _ Starch is mainly used for energy storage in plants _ Cellulose is mainly used for maintaining plant structure _ These three molecules are all made of glucose, so why do they have such different functions? The main difference is how the glucose monomers are linked together _ This is a prime example of one of the central themes of biology: form affects function."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b6,These differences are explained in more detail below.
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_b7,"Chitin, a modified structural polysaccharide, is best known as a major component of the exoskeleton (hard outer shell) of arthropods (e.g., beetles, crabs, lobsters) and mollusks (e.g., snails, clams, scallops) _ However, chitin also plays a minor role in the cell structure of some fungi, algae, and yeasts _ Chitin (C8H13NO5)n is comprised of slightly-modified glucose monomers."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c1,"Digestible carbohydrates provide energy in a form that is easily accessible _ Glucose, with the chemical formula C6H12O6, is a simple sugar and a monosaccharide _ It is one of the most abundant and important energy molecules for living things _ The energy stored in covalent bonds between atoms (within a glucose molecule, in this case) is released during cellular respiration, when glucose is broken down and converted to simpler, more stable molecules _ This energy can be captured to make ATP, which can then be used to power cellular processes _ This will be covered in greater detail in the metabolism unit."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c2,"In animals, excess glucose molecules are linked together (through an anabolic pathway) to make a long branching polysaccharide called glycogen _ Glycogen is primarily stored in the liver, with small amounts being stored in the muscles _ Once glycogen stores are filled, the body begins storing excess food calories as fat _ Conversely, when food intake is insufficient to keep up with energy requirements, the body will break down its glycogen stores to release individual glucose monosaccharides."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c3,"Starch, another branching polysaccharide, is the primary form in which excess glucose is stored in plants (and other producers) _ Starch, just like glycogen, is composed of individual glucose monomers joined together _ And, like glycogen, starch is broken down to release individual glucose molecules that can be used to build ATP _ The difference between these two energy storage polysaccharides lies in the organization of the glucose monosaccharides."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c4,"Cellulose, like glycogen and starch, is a polysaccharide that is made up of many glucose monosaccharides linked together _ Cellulose is an important structural carbohydrate that provides support within plant cell walls _ This carbohydrate is indigestible by humans and most animals _ Some animals (e.g _ cows, horses, and termites) can digest this carbohydrate _ These animals have symbiotic (“living together”) bacteria that inhabit their digestive tract _ The bacteria produce enzymes that break down cellulose, making sugar available to their hosts _ "
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c5,"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the molecules involved with storing our genetic information (DNA) or the conversion of that information into proteins (RNA) _ Sugars (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA) play a part in the structure of these nucleic acid molecules _ They alternate with phosphate groups to make up the long backbone of nucleic acids, as shown below."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_c6,"Although we will not delve into the specifics of this topic, carbohydrates play a variety of roles in identification and signaling _ One of the ways your immune system is able to identify foreign invaders is through detection of the different carbohydrates displayed on the surface of cells _ Additionally, the first step in fertilization between a sperm and egg is generally believed to involve carbohydrate-to-carbohydrate interactions _ As a final example, the specific carbohydrates attached to the surface of your red blood cells determine your “blood group” (A,B,O) and predict what kind of blood you can safely receive in a transfusion."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_d1,"Indigestible carbohydrates, which cannot be degraded by human digestive enzymes, are referred to as dietary fiber _ Cellulose, mentioned above as a major component of plant cell walls, is one of the largest contributors of dietary fiber _ Pectin is another structural carbohydrate found in most plants, especially apples and citrus fruits, and is commonly used as a gelling agent to make jams and jellies _ A diet high in fiber has several benefits _ Dietary fiber plays a role in maintaining regular digestive functioning, slowing the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, and reducing bad cholesterol _ So the old saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” does have some truth to it, since there are proven health benefits associated with the consumption of foods that are high in fiber, like apples _ Other foods that are high in fiber are oatmeal, popcorn, raspberries, black beans, lentils, and peas, to name a few."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_d2,"For a quick boost of energy, simple sugars are the carbohydrate of choice; diabetics will oftentimes carry a sugary food or drink with them in case their blood sugar level drops too low _ However, excessively high blood sugar levels can be equally dangerous _ Accordingly, doctors routinely suggest that diabetics eat a diet high in fiber to help manage their diabetes, since fiber helps to slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, which helps diabetics to prevent spikes in blood sugar _ In contrast with simple sugars, complex carbohydrates are broken down by the body more slowly and energy is released in a stepwise fashion."
transformations_energy_matter,biochem_carbs_quiz_wrapper1,"All living organisms contain four major classes of macromolecules, one of which is carbohydrates _ Often referred to as ""carbs,"" carbohydrate molecules consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 1:2:1 ratio _ Complex carbohydrates are built when simple sugar molecules are covalently bonded together _ The main function of carbohydrates is to store energy, which the living organism can use at a later time _ Carbohydrates also function as structural materials and in cellular signaling and recognition."

transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_unit_intro_rev2,"All living organisms — from bacteria to trees to humans — are composed of molecules _ To make a cell, many molecules must be combined, and it takes energy to build these complex structures _ Covalent bonds hold these molecules together, and the chemical bonds contain energy associated with the force that holds two atoms together _ As you know, some bonds are relatively weak and unstable _ When they are replaced by stronger, more stable bonds, chemical potential energy is released that can be captured by the cell and used to do work _ In cells, certain high-energy molecules contain many unstable bonds and are used for fuel _ When these molecules are broken down into simpler molecules with more stable bonds, chemical potential energy is released _ In this unit, you will learn how cells manage to capture this energy and use it to do work (e.g., power movement or build new macromolecules) _ "

transformations_energy_matter,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1rev2,"In a 1665 publication called Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens _ Later, he confirmed van Leeuwenhoek’s 1678 discovery of bacteria and protozoa _ Later advances in lenses and microscope construction enabled other scientists to see some components inside cells."
transformations_energy_matter,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1rev3,"By the late 1830s, scientists had closely examined many plant and animal tissues under the microscope _ Comparing notes, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann realized that cells were found in every tissue they had studied _ They proposed the Unified Cell Theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that the cell is the basic unit of life _ You, for instance, are made of approximately 60 trillion cells, all of which originated from one single cell, the fertilized cell produced when an egg from your mother was fertilized by the sperm cell from your father."
transformations_energy_matter,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1rev4,"However, there were still controversies between those who believed in the existence of a vital force able to “create” life (spontaneous generation) and those who supported biogenesis, which claims that living cells can arise only from pre-existing cells _ A series of experiments by Louis Pasteur and Rudolf Virchow showed that living organisms could only come from other living organisms _ The currently accepted tenets of Cell Theory are:"

transformations_energy_matter,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1rev6,Modern cell theorists assert that all functions essential to life occur within the cell and that during cell division the cell contains and transmits to the next generation the information necessary to conduct and regulate cell functioning.
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b1,"Cells in living organisms have two basic requirements: energy and carbon _ Cells require a source of high-energy electrons to produce chemical energy and a source of carbon-containing molecules that can be used to synthesize proteins, fatty acids, and other molecules _ The principle source of energy for all organisms on earth is the sun _ This light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic organisms such as plants and algae and used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to glucose and oxygen during photosynthesis _ The end result is that the energy from the sun has been stored in glucose, a small six-carbon carbohydrate _ The oxygen and glucose are then available to other living organisms _ Humans (and all other organisms, including plants) use glucose as food, and release the energy in glucose through a process called respiration _ We usually think of respiration as the act of breathing preformed by many organisms to take in oxygen _ However, in cells, respiration more specifically is the process of breaking down large molecules (nutrients, such as glucose) into simpler molecules including some of the energy released and stored as chemical energy in the molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) _ There are two types of respiration: aerobic respiration requires oxygen and anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen _ A commonly known form of anaerobic respiration is fermentation, the process used to produce wines, distilled liquors, and other products _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b2," The diagram below illustrates this process of photosynthesis, fermentation, and aerobic respiration _ During aerobic respiration, the carbon atoms in glucose combine with oxygen to produce CO2; the glucose is oxidized, releasing energy _ The energy from the oxidation of glucose is stored in a small chemical called ATP for immediate use by the cell _ ATP is used for almost all of the energy needs of the cell, from the synthesis of other complex molecules to doing mechanical work, such as running _ You will learn more about these two pathways in the section about “Anabolic and Catabolic Reactions.” "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b3,"Many microorganisms, such as yeast, can utilize the energy stored in glucose in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic growth); the most common form of this process is fermentation _ In the absence of oxygen, yeasts still produce ATP by the partial oxidation of glucose, releasing smaller amounts of CO2 _ The remaining carbon atoms in the glucose are converted to ethanol _ The energy stored in ethanol can be used as fuel for our internal combustion engines _ Humans also undergo anaerobic metabolism during vigorous exercise, but in humans, lactic acid is produced instead of ethanol _ When sufficient oxygen becomes available, the carbon atoms in lactate are converted to CO2 _ Other organisms that perform fermentation produce a variety of other end products _ Fermentation is discussed as an alternative pathway in the module on Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b4,"All metabolic pathways are regulated such that they are only active when the products of the pathway are required by the cell _ In this way, the organism is able to optimize the use of its carbon and energy resources _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b5," The first part of the process of respiration is called glycolysis _ It consists basically of the breakdown of glucose into a smaller compound called pyruvate _ Pyruvate can then go on to either cellular respiration or fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen _ Glycolysis will occur if the cell requires energy _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b6,"The glycolysis pathway is regulated to turn glycolysis on or off, depending on the energy needs of the cell _ There would be two dire consequences if the energy that is stored in food were to be released immediately after consumption _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b7,"First, the organism would run out of energy quickly and would therefore have to consume food all the time, which is not possible for most organisms, especially mammals, which need to sleep _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metabolism_introduction_1b8,"Secondly, the heat that would be released by the production of energy would raise the temperature of the organism to intolerable levels _ Misregulation of metabolic pathways can cause disease _ For example, in diabetes, the metabolism of glucose is incorrectly regulated."
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_11,"All living things need energy to run the processes required for life _ Energy is defined as the capacity to do work _ You can think of “work” as any change that won’t happen on its own _ Work can involve movement, building larger molecules, increasing the concentration of chemicals, increasing the temperature of an object, making a sound, or even glowing (bioluminescence)."
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_12,"Energy is recognized by what it DOES: it makes “work” happen _ It makes things change _ Energy exists in many forms _ Some biologically important forms of energy are light energy, electrical energy, sound energy, and thermal or heat energy _ Kinetic energy is the energy of motion _ Potential energy is stored energy _ Energy can change forms and often transforms from potential to kinetic energy, and back _ In biology, a key form of potential energy is chemical energy: the energy stored in chemical bonds _ It can be released when certain bonds are broken _ Chemical energy is released when wood is burned: the bonds in the wood are broken, releasing light and heat energy."
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_13,"The first example below shows a single-celled organism — an amoeba — using energy to move _ The second example illustrates the chemical reaction resulting in urea, a molecule found in urine _ The third example shows bioluminescence — the emission of light by living organisms; in this case, the aurelia aurita jelly fish."
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_1b1," Energy can be converted from one form to another _ In the image below, the chemical energy in the wood is converted to light and heat _ After the fire dies, the heat and light have dissipated and are no longer available for living organisms _ Energy in our biosphere is a one-way system: It comes from the sun, is captured by living organisms, and eventually is released back out as heat _ "
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_1b2,"Energy cannot be created or destroyed _ Instead, energy is transformed from one form to another _ Imagine that you climb a mountain trail ending in a steep cliff _ Your body’s movement (kinetic energy) is fueled by chemical energy from your food _ As you move uphill, your body’s chemical potential energy decreases (you break down molecules and use up stored food energy) _ At the same time, your body’s gravitational potential energy increases _ This kind of potential energy can be released by letting an object drop from a height _ A fall from the top of the cliff would do a great deal of “work,” so watch your step!"
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_1b3,"Where does chemical energy in food come from? The sun provides solar energy, the energy source for most living things _ Plants and other photosynthetic organisms can use solar energy to build sugar molecules from simpler raw materials (carbon dioxide and water) _ A sugar molecule stores chemical energy in the bonds that join its atoms _ The energy stored in sugar can be released and used to build other types of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, etc.), which also contain stored chemical energy in their complex structures."
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_1d1,"To us, it seems that the sun has burned forever and will always keep shining _ However, the sun is fueled by nuclear energy generated by atoms colliding in its incredibly hot core _ Eventually, the supply of fuel in the sun will be depleted and our sun’s long life will end _ This illustrates an inescapable fact about energy: it tends to lose quality over time _ It dissipates, spreading out in space, and loses its intensity _ "
transformations_energy_matter,what_is_energy_1d2,"Heat is the energy possessed by any substance because of the random jiggling of its molecules and atoms _ It is a low form of energy, disorderly, and spreads out rapidly through most materials _ Every kind of energy conversion generates at least some heat energy as a byproduct _ For example, the breakdown and use of chemical energy in food also releases heat _ Heat can be helpful in keeping our bodies warm, but for the most part heat energy is a loss: an energy waste that cannot be recovered _ No organism can capture heat and use it to do work or to make food _ Instead, heat seeps out of organisms and eventually into space, leaving the biosphere forever."
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v01,"Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is an organic molecule that acts as the direct energy source for almost all cellular activities _ ATP consists of a single adenosine molecule (composed of an adenine bound to a ribose sugar) linked to three phosphate ions _ "
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v02,"ATP is a relatively unstable molecule _ Consequently it is never used for the long-term storage of energy in the cell _ This job goes to other more stable compounds, like fats and sugars _ ATP is specialized for direct and rapid transfers of energy _ It is because of this instability that ATP is such a good energy currency for the cell (it’s easy to “spend” this energy) _ ATP is like cash, while long-term energy storage molecules (such as fats and sugars) are more like a savings account _ "
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v0b1,"ATP is an important molecule in biological systems because of its high energy phosphate bonds _ Energy is stored as chemical energy _ Energy is released when ATP reacts with water to form ADP or AMP _ Here's how: Cells gain energy stored in ATP by transferring the terminal phosphate group _ The chemical bond between the last two phosphates is unstable, and reactions that involve the removal of the terminal (last) phosphate release energy _ This bond can be broken in a reaction involving water _ This reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction (""hydro"" means ""water"" and ""lysis"" means ""separation""; together they mean ""using water to separate"") _ The products of this reaction are inorganic phosphate (P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which has only two phosphate groups _ Taken together, ADP and P are more stable than ATP _ The net result of ATP hydrolysis is the release of energy _ This process is illustrated in the animation below _ "
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v0b2,"ATP, the molecule with the higher energy content, can react to form ADP + P _ This chemical reaction can also be reversed and, in so doing, cells replenish ATP _ ADP + P can combine to form ATP, a reaction referred to as a condensation reaction since two molecules are condensed into one _ We know the first reaction (ATP → ADP + P) releases energy _ Therefore, the second reaction (ADP + P → ATP) requires energy _ The opposing reactions are like using and charging a rechargeable battery _ When you use the energy stored in the rechargeable battery, it is like using up ATP (ATP hydrolysis) _ When you recharge the battery, you must put energy in (by plugging it into the electrical socket) _ This is like ATP formation, which is usually fueled by chemical energy extracted from sugar or fats."
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v0b3,"Virtually all the activities of the cell are powered by the energy released when ATP loses its terminal phosphate _ For example, ATP hydrolysis provides the energy needed to form complex molecules from simpler ones (synthesis) _ ATP can also transfer energy by making proteins change shape when ATP is converted to ADP _ When proteins change shape, their microscopic movements can add up to macroscopic motion, such as occurs when entire muscles contract _ Similarly, ATP can transfer energy to specialized transport proteins embedded in the cell membrane and enable materials to be pumped in or out of the cell, against their concentration gradients (active transport)."
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v0c1,"The energy difference between ATP and ADP is largely due to the interaction between the negatively charged phosphate groups in each molecule _ You may remember that unlike charges (+ and -) attract each other, while like charges (+ and +; or - and -) repel each other _ Energy is therefore required to move two negative charges close to each other, which is what happens when ATP is made from ADP and phosphate _ This is similar to the way in which energy is required to bring the two north poles of a bar magnet together."
transformations_energy_matter,Metab_ATP_v0c2,"Examine the following figure, which illustrates the change in energy found within a chemical system as a phosphate ion is slowly brought closer to an ADP molecule _ As the negatively charged phosphate gets closer to the negatively charged ADP molecule, more energy is required to overcome the particles' natural tendency to repel each other."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_11,"Most life on Earth is fueled by solar energy through the process of photosynthesis _ Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight to make organic molecules from simple raw materials (carbon dioxide and water) _ Cellular respiration and other processes break down organic molecules and use the energy released to build ATP molecules _ ATP then transfers energy to drive many important processes in cells including movement, transport, and synthesis _ In this way, the energy from the sun is transformed to chemical energy in molecules such as glucose and ATP _ Eventually energy is released in forms like motion, heat, sound, or light _ Each chemical transformation process releases heat as a byproduct _ In fact, most of the energy is lost as heat, only a small fraction is used to do work _ This heat can be useful for organisms to regulate their internal temperatures."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_12,"Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are the most common metabolic pathways _ Together they form a cycle comprising the general flow of energy through the biosphere _ Sunlight provides the essential source of energy _ Plants and other photosynthetic organisms capture this energy, and through a chemical reaction with carbon dioxide and water, the photosynthesis process converts the light energy to chemical energy, and produces glucose and oxygen _ Organisms ingest the glucose and oxygen, and through the process of cellular respiration (i.e., aerobic respiration), break down these large molecules producing carbon dioxide and water _ The outputs of cellular respiration then become the raw materials for photosynthesis."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b1," Living organisms consume food, in the form of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids, to live _ The process of metabolism breaks these complex biomolecules into simple molecules with the release of energy _ The most common form of energy is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) _ This high energy phosphorylated compound is used as a energy source in many cellular processes and for bio-mechanical functions, such as muscle contraction or ion transport across membranes _ The resultant compounds and energy released from food are used to synthesize complex molecules for the specialized needs of the cell or organism."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b2,"Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions within a living organism _ A chemical reaction is a chemical change in which new molecules are formed from existing molecules _ Reactions that release energy are called exergonic (“exer” refers to “out” and “gonic” refers to “energy,” so these are “energy out” reactions) _ Reactions that require energy are called endergonic (“energy in”) _ Exergonic reactions can be used to power endergonic reactions _ For example, building ATP from ADP and a phosphate molecule requires energy (it is an endergonic reaction) _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b3,"The transformation of ingested food to energy and simple compounds, or the synthesis of complex molecules, is performed by a series of enzymatic reactions _ Collectively, these enzymes, and their substrates and products, are referred to as a metabolic pathway."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b4,"Technically, metabolic pathways are ordered sets of chemical reactions that occur within a cell to modify an initial molecule to form another product; enzymes catalyze (or increase) the rate of reaction _ Metabolic pathways are catabolic (break-down molecules) or anabolic (synthesize or combine molecules) and result in molecular products which can be used by the cell immediately, used to initiate another chemical reaction, or stored in the cell _ You will explore catabolism and anabolism further in the next sections."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b5,"Catabolic reactions (also called “catabolism”) break down larger, more complex molecules into smaller molecules and release energy in the process _ The smaller end products of a catabolic reaction may be released as waste or they may be fed into other reactions _ The energy that is released by catabolic reactions can be captured and used in many ways _ Some of the energy is released as heat and increases the temperature of the cell _ Sometimes the energy is stored in the chemical bonds of another molecule _ And sometimes it can be used to do work, such as movement of cellular machinery to power the active transport of materials across cell membranes _ Catabolic pathways generally are degradative, releasing energy and electrons from oxidative processes;"
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b6,"i.e., the electrons, which are carried on organic electron carriers, can be used to generate additional energy, or can be used for synthetic purposes _ Catabolic reactions are central to biological processes such as cellular respiration and the digestion of food molecules."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b7,"Cellular respiration is catabolic because it takes glucose (a complex molecule with 6 carbons) and reduces it to carbon dioxide (each with only one carbon) and water (oxygen joined to two hydrogens) _ Some of the energy released by this process is captured in ATP, which can be stored for later use."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b8,"Digestion of protein is also a catabolic reaction _ It takes a very large protein molecule and breaks it down into several smaller polypeptides, then dismantles the polypeptides to yield individual amino acids _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b9,"Anabolic reactions (also referred to as ""anabolism"") use energy to build more complex molecules from relatively simple raw materials _ Synthetic, or anabolic pathways consume energy and are generally reductive, requiring electrons _ “Anabolic” and “catabolic” sound similar but are opposites _ To remember the difference, it may help to think about how “anabolic steroids” promote the buildup of muscle mass _ All of the complex molecules of life — carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids — are generated by anabolic reactions _ Anabolic reactions are central to processes like photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and DNA replication."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b10,"At this point, you may wonder why the cell has to break down complex molecules in order to build them up again _ Different cells use and require different biomolecules for their specialized functions _ For example, carbohydrates are good sources of energy _ In plants, carbohydrates are usually stored as starch _ In animals, they are stored as glycogen _ Both are polymers of glucose, but they have different structures, and an animal cell cannot readily store or access starch _ When an athlete “carbo-loads” the evening before a race, starches from foods like pasta are digested to simple sugars in a catabolic reaction _ They are then rebuilt as glycogen (in an anabolic reaction) in the muscles and liver _ That way, there is some extra energy stored and easily accessible for the muscle cells to use for the big race _ Biomolecules are broken down to raw materials, then rebuilt in a different form to meet the needs of the organism _ One molecule that is unique to your cells is DNA _ No other organism (except an identical twin) has the same DNA as you, so your cells need to build it anew in order to pass it on to the next generation"
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b11,"Photosynthesis is an anabolic process you’ll learn more about in this unit _ Protein synthesis is an amazing feat of anabolism _ Protein chains (polypeptides) are produced by linking together relatively simple amino acid monomers _ In one polypeptide, thousands of amino acids may be strung together, and several different polypeptides may fold and bind to each other to form a large and complex protein molecule."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1b12,Characteristics of catabolic and anabolic reactions are summarized in the table below.
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1c1,"Life requires energy to accomplish its anabolic reactions _ This energy cannot be “made” from nothing, because energy cannot be created or destroyed _ But energy can be transferred and transformed _ Energy that is available to the cell must somehow be packaged in useful form and delivered where it is needed _ This problem is solved through chemical transfers of energy from catabolic reactions to energy carriers and then from the energy carriers to the substrates that are joined in anabolic reactions _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_ac_reactions_1c2,"Life’s universal energy carrier is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) _ ATP acts as a shuttle that transfers energy from catabolic reactions that release energy from complex molecules (such as cellular respiration) to the anabolic reactions that consume energy (such as protein synthesis) _ The energy released from catabolic reactions can be stored for later use through the formation of ATP by combining ADP plus a phosphate group _ Then, when energy is required for anabolic reactions, ATP can be broken down into ADP and a phosphate group, releasing energy that was stored in the phosphate bond _ "

transformations_energy_matter,metab_energy_quiz_wrapper4,The following key terms were introduced in this module: 
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathways_common_characteristics_11,"In the previous modules, you learned about metabolic pathways in cells — those “freeways” that shuttle energy and carbon in different directions _ Metabolic pathways can be either anabolic or catabolic _ Anabolic pathways build things up and catabolic pathways break them back down again, sometimes as a source of energy, other times to obtain building materials _ Among the main pathways of the cell are photosynthesis and cellular respiration, although there are a variety of alternative pathways such as fermentation."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathways_common_characteristics_12,"Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes _ At the heart of metabolism are enzymes _ These proteins embrace substrates, quickly generating products _ One or more substrates bind to an enzyme’s active site _ As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would _ Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt _ Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in _ A huge diversity of enzymes is required to run the metabolic reactions necessary to maintain even a single cell."
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3c1,Enzymes catalyze many different types of chemical reactions _ Some of the reactions are synthetic and result in products that are more complex than the original substrates _ This is often done by binding two substrates together _ Synthetic metabolic pathways like this are called anabolic pathways.
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3c2,Other enzymes catalyze reactions that reduce the substrate to simpler products _ These enzymes catalyze reactions in catabolic pathways _ 
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3c3,"An example of an enzyme that is involved in catabolism is lactase _ Lactase is produced in the intestinal tract of mammals and breaks the sugar in milk, lactose, down into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose so that they can be metabolized to produce energy."
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3c4,"Unfortunately, in many adults the ability to produce lactase is diminished _ Without adequate lactase, ingested lactose from milk and cheese is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine _ Instead, the lactose goes to the large intestine, where it is converted into large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas by the bacteria in the large intestine _ These individuals are lactose intolerant and should avoid eating foods with high milk content _ "

transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathways_common_characteristics_1a4,Metabolic pathways (such as cellular respiration) are nearly universal _ These organisms all use similar pathways.
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathways_common_characteristics_1a5," Each pathway contains multiple intermediate products, and there are small molecular differences between the intermediates _ Pathways proceed in “baby steps.” A chemical change that can be written and balanced as a single reaction may, in a real pathway, require dozens of reaction steps! An Example of a Linear Metabolic Pathway This pathway shows the production of the end product “D” from the starting substrate “A.” In this reaction, A is the substrate of enzyme 1, which produces B _ Enzyme 2 then uses B as its substrate to produce C _ Enzyme 3 then uses C as its substrate to produce D _ Each step within the pathway, or the conversion from one intermediate to the next, is catalyzed by an enzyme _ Thousands of enzymes catalyze reactions in human cells _ Each enzyme conducts a single chemical reaction _ The coordination of many enzymes working together can produce a variety of outcomes _ An Example of a Branched Metabolic Pathway Each enzyme within the pathway is specific to one reaction _ The direction of the arrows indicate that this pathway is an anabolic, or synthetic, pathway where complex biomolecules D and F are synthesized using the simpler molecule A as starting material _ The coordinated effort of many enzymes can produce a variety of final products _ Each pathway is regulated to ensure the optimal use of resources and to maintain the health of the cell _ For example, if there is plenty of ATP in a cell, the cellular respiration pathway (which produces ATP as its final product) will slow down _ In a complex web of cause and effect, pathways influence themselves and each other _ The net effect in a healthy cell is the maintenance of homeostasis _ Stockpiles of raw materials, intermediates, and finished products are maintained at optimal levels, and the chemistry of the cell cytosol is also regulated, as are extracellular fluids _ Many metabolic pathways are reversible, which means that certain chemical reactions can go “either way,” depending on the needs of the cell _ For example, some of the reactions that are part of cellular respiration (which is a catabolic pathway) can become anabolic when there is a surplus of energy _ A small number of steps utilize different enzymes in the forward versus the reverse direction _ These enzymes are regulated in a coordinated fashion such that a pathway operates in only direction at time _ Catabolic and Anabolic Reactions Animals use fats and complex carbohydrates such as glycogen for long-term energy storage _ When energy is needed, catabolic pathways degrade lipids and glycogen to glucose or other intermediates of the cellular respiration pathway, resulting in ATP production _ When there is excess ATP (for example after eating a meal rich in fats and sugars), parts of the cellular respiration pathway go “in reverse” to provide building blocks for the anabolic reactions building up lipids and glycogen _ "

transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_12,Metabolic pathways are regulated in order to maintain maximum efficiency or in response to environmental changes.
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_13,"There are two major methods of pathway regulation _ The first method involves changing the amount of the enzymes in the pathway _ Since the reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes, if the enzyme is not present, the pathway is effectively shut off _ Enzyme levels are usually altered by controlling the amount of mRNA produced from the gene that encodes the enzyme _ You will explore how enzyme levels are regulated in the section on transcription."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_14,"Regulation of pathways by altering the amount of enzymes in the pathway is usually too slow to meet the second-by-second regulation needs of the organism _ Consequently, many pathways are regulated by increasing or decreasing the activity of an enzyme due to the binding of a small regulatory compound _ Typically, only a few steps in the pathway are regulated, and the regulated steps typically occur near the beginning of the pathway to prevent the accumulation of intermediates, which are seldom of use to the cell _ Think of an assembly line: the speed of production will change depending on how much of the starting material is available, how quickly each of the workers completes the task, and how much of the final product is needed _ Similarly, pathways are influenced by the availability of the starting materials, the activity of each enzyme in the pathway, and the concentration of product already present in the cell."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_15,"Let’s look at an example of a metabolic pathway and explore one mechanism that regulates it _ You may remember that cellular respiration is an essential catabolic pathway _ Cellular respiration starts with a pathway called glycolysis, which degrades three-carbon glucose into a three-carbon molecule called pyruvate _ Glucose can come from ingested carbohydrates, or from degradation of glycogen, a polysaccharide _ When there is an excess of carbohydrates, they are stored as glycogen in an anabolic pathway."

transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3b2,The substrate binds to the enzyme by interacting with amino acids in the binding site _ The binding site on enzymes is often referred to as the active site because it contains amino acids that both bind the substrate and aid in its conversion to product.
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3b3,"You can often recognize that a protein is an enzyme by its name _ Many enzyme names end with “-ase.” For example, the enzyme lactase is used to break down the sugar lactose, found in mammalian milk _ Other enzymes are known by a common name, such as pepsin, which is an enzyme that aids in the digestion of proteins in your stomach by breaking the peptide bonds in the proteins _ "
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3b4,"Enzymes are catalysts, meaning that they make a reaction go faster, but the enzymes themselves are not altered by the overall reaction _ Examine this image to see how enzymes work."
transformations_energy_matter,acids_and_proteins_3b5,"The amino acids in the active site of enzymes play two roles, and sometimes those roles overlap _ Some of the amino acids in the active site are responsible for binding of the substrate and others are responsible for facilitating the chemical reaction _ Enzymes are generally quite specific for their substrates _ Although lactase and pepsin both catalyze the same type of reaction, breaking a bond using water (hydrolysis: ""hydro"" means ""water"" and ""lysis"" means ""to break""), lactase only functions when lactose is its substrate and pepsin can only break peptide bonds."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_1a1,"Six general mechanisms can regulate the rate of each step in a pathway _ The mechanisms differ in how rapidly they can respond to changes in the environment _ Each of them is discussed below, with the more rapid forms of regulation at the top of the list."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_1a2," Substrate availability _ If the substrate concentration increases, the rate of a reaction will increase _ Put simply, substrates must collide with enzymes to initiate binding _ Such collisions will occur more often if the substrate is highly concentrated _ Note that too much of the substrate can saturate the enzyme, so above a certain amount of substrate, the reaction speed will not increase anymore _ Competitive inhibition _ An inhibitor “competes” with the substrate for the active site _ If the inhibitor binds first, the substrate is blocked from entering and the enzyme is inhibited (cannot complete any reactions) _ Competitive inhibitors are often used as drugs to block an undesirable metabolic pathway _ For example, sulfa antibiotics are competitive inhibitors of the bacterial pathway that produces folic acid, an essential molecule for nucleic acid synthesis _ Products of a reaction are often competitive inhibitors, because they bind to the active site _ Noncompetitive control _ This mechanism is similar to competitive control, except in this case substances bind to a site away from the active site _ Binding can either enhance or inhibit the enzyme’s function by changing the shape of the active site _ This is the example that you saw above with glycolysis _ Feedback inhibition _ Both competitive and noncompetitive controls are often set up so that a product inhibits its own production by inhibiting enzymes at an early step in the synthesis process _ This regulates the pathway: the product “turns off” its own production by inhibiting an enzyme on its own “assembly line.” This prevents the overproduction of a substance and also prevents the waste of resources on unnecessary intermediate products _ Feedback inhibition is observed when a product inhibits an earlier step in the pathway _ Product inhibition occurs when the product inhibits the enzyme that was directly involved in making that product _ Modification of the enzyme _ Chemical modification of enzymes (such as adding a phosphate group) can cause a change in the shape of the active site of the enzyme _ The change may either increase or decrease enzyme activity _ This is similar to noncompetitive control, except in this case the enzyme is chemically modified and control does not involve the binding of a large molecule to the enzyme _ Changing enzyme concentrations _ Enzyme levels can be increased by 1) conversion of inactive forms of the enzyme to active forms, or 2) regulating the synthesis of the enzyme _ An example of the former is blood clotting, where inactive precursors of clotting enzymes become activated, in a cascade, by blood vessel damage _ This permits a very quick response to bleeding: all the necessary factors are present and require only an activating signal _ Similarly, many digestive enzymes are activated only when they reach their destination (for example, gastric fluid of low pH) _ Elsewhere they are inactive — and thus do not digest the organ that secretes them _ It takes longer to adjust enzyme levels by regulating the activity of genes that produce them _ Such changes are most often seen in response to longer-term changes in the environment _ For example, bacteria turn genes for digestive enzymes on and off depending on the nutrients that are available to them _ Many animal genes are produced only during certain stages of development _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_1a3,"Consider the following pathway, where compound A is metabolized to compound C, and answer the following questions _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_pathway_regulation_1a4,"In summary, metabolic pathways are dynamic processes, continuously changing in response to environmental changes and cellular (or organismal) needs, while avoiding waste of resources _ How much substrate or enzyme is available will determine the rate of reactions _ Moreover, extreme “fine-tuning” of metabolism is possible through changes in enzyme activity due to the binding of inhibitors _ This is a prime example of the relationship between structure and function _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_11,"To this point, you have learned much about how pathways work _ They proceed as a series of steps catalyzed by enzymes _ They are regulated by factors that modify enzymes or alter the expression of genes."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_12,"In living organisms, metabolic processes are tightly regulated under normal conditions _ The cell, and the organism as a whole (e.g., the human body), tend to respond to external influences in ways that maintain a relatively stable internal environment _ This ability or tendency is called homeostasis and depends on a complex set of stabilizing responses _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_13,"Cells live in dynamic environments _ Therefore, it takes work to keep conditions stable in a cell _ Precise regulation enables the cell (or body) to establish consistent internal conditions _ Factors like pH, ion concentrations, and levels of various substrates and products are held within narrow bounds _ This unique environment allows a diverse set of reactions to take place _ Many of these chemical reactions are essential for life and all of them help maintain overall health."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_14,"You had to work at staying upright because your body was in motion _ In the cell or inside a body, countless dynamic processes are running at once _ Many of them could easily disturb internal chemistry and throw things out of whack _ So could changes in the external environment _ As a result, many levels of regulation are constantly at work within your body, keeping internal processes balanced and compensating for external changes."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_15,"These concepts are not just academic, textbook issues _ To the contrary! Many of today’s most challenging health problems center on the regulation of metabolism _ The loss of proper regulation can result in a number of diseases or disorders _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_16,"Substances that inhibit enzymes in a central pathway can have deadly effects for the cell or organism _ For instance, the potent poisons cyanide and arsenic are inhibitors of cellular respiration _ Lack of regulation, or dysregulation, of metabolic pathways can lead to serious diseases _ Examples include phenylketonuria (PKU), Tay-Sachs disease, galactosemia, and maple syrup urine disease _ Each of these is an inherited condition in which an altered gene produces an enzyme that does not function normally _ As a result, metabolism is disrupted and health problems occur."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_17,"On the other hand, drugs often target metabolic pathways to correct diseases _ For instance, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that are commonly used to control high blood pressure _ These drugs inhibit ACE; the result is reduced production of angiotensin, a molecule that increases blood pressure."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a1,"Many humans are able to maintain a stable adult body weight over a large number of years _ Although it may seem perfectly normal, this is an amazing feat of metabolic regulation _ As you eat, foods are broken down and metabolized _ But the energy stored in the food’s chemical bonds cannot be destroyed _ Simply put, if more calories are consumed than are required for growth, activity, and maintenance, the excess energy is stored within the body _ This energy is stored when enzymes catalyze the formation of new chemical bonds to create specific kinds of macromolecules (i.e., glycogen, fat, and protein), which tends to increase overall body mass _ On the other hand, if not enough food calories are consumed, the body will begin to break down its own tissues as a source of energy, and will decline in mass as a result."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a2,"Note that when “calories” are being discussed in reference to food consumption, the word ""calorie"" actually refers to a kilocalorie _ One kilocalorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius _ It is the unit typically used when discussing human nutrition and energy balance _ For your reference, a typical adult male requires about 2,500 calories per day; a female of average size might require 2,000 calories daily _ The body’s calorie requirement declines with age, and depends on many factors, including body size, sex, and physical activity."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a3,"A pound of body fat stores a total of about 3,500 calories _ Use the calculator below to answer the following questions _ In the entry boxes, enter calorie surpluses or deficits _ A calorie surplus occurs when more calories are taken in than the body expends _ A calorie deficit results when more calories are expended through maintenance and activity than are obtained from food _ "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a4,"As you have seen, the balance between caloric intake and output must be held within narrow limits to maintain a steady body weight _ Yet some humans do this without conscious effort _ How does this remarkable balancing act work? "
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a5,"First, consider what happens over the course of a typical day _ After a meal, extra calories are initially stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a complex carbohydrate) _ Glycogen is broken down and used to supply glucose for intense exercise, and to provide glucose while we sleep _ Breakfast provides fuel to rebuild some of the body’s glycogen stores that were depleted overnight _ Thus, over short time scales, glycogen storage is an efficient way to provide glucose when it’s needed between meals."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a6,"Over longer time periods, body fat is used to store excess energy _ When glycogen stores are full, the body switches over to storing the excess energy as fat _ Remember that energy is stored within chemical bonds, and so it is the chemical bonds within glycogen and fat molecules that contain energy _ Fat is an efficient way for the body to store extra calories, because it is able to pack more calories per unit mass when compared with carbohydrates or proteins (see Figure 8.2 below) _ You can think of body fat as a long-term, highly compacted energy reserve."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a7,"How are caloric intake and energy output balanced? Your levels of hunger and overall metabolic rate change in response to your nutritional status _ When your stomach is empty, a hormone called ghrelin is secreted _ This acts on receptors in the brain to stimulate feelings of hunger _ When the stomach is full, ghrelin secretion stops and so do your cravings for food."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a8,"If a person takes in less calories than required for maintenance and activity, glycogen reserves are broken down first _ This leads to rapid weight loss early on, because each gram of glycogen associates with up to four grams of water _ As glycogen is broken down, water is released in urine _ Most of the initial weight loss is actually “water weight.”"
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a9,"Later weight loss comes more slowly, because body fat stores a great deal of energy and is associated with much less water _ Importantly, body fat is not just a storage bin _ It also has a role as an endocrine (hormone-secreting) organ _ For example, body fat secretes a hormone called leptin _ This acts on target cells in the brain to produce feelings of “fullness.” Loss of body fat leads to decreases in leptin and increasing feelings of hunger _ Second, loss of weight also has effects on a person’s energy output _ As a person loses weight, total metabolism goes down simply because the body is getting smaller _ More significantly, the per-pound rate of metabolism is turned down to conserve energy and resist what the body perceives as “starvation.” A person in this state will feel sluggish and reluctant to exercise _ Taken together, these and other mechanisms tend to automatically adjust our hunger and activity to maintain our weight."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a10,"Obesity is a condition in which body fat is excessive and interferes with normal function or impairs health _ Obesity can make many physical activities difficult or impossible _ It is associated with many increased health risks; type II diabetes (see below), hypertension, and heart disease are three serious conditions that are clearly more common among obese people than their normal-weight peers _ Obese people also suffer socially and professionally because of weight-related bias and discrimination."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a11,"Why don’t the normal regulatory mechanisms work to limit weight in people who become obese? This is a question that has fueled considerable research and debate _ Findings suggest that there are many contributing factors _ For example, many (but not all) obese individuals have very high circulating levels of leptin in keeping with their high body fat reserves _ Yet the target cells in their brains do not respond to leptin in the normal way; they do not perceive satisfaction or fullness."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a12,"Obesity may result from a mismatch between our evolutionary adaptations and the realities of the modern world _ We expend less calories each day on physical tasks than did previous generations of humans _ More than 100 years ago, the average person may have expended 30 percent to 50 percent more calories each day than a typical modern American _ In addition, today we have continuous access to an unprecedented array of calorie-rich foods _ In times past, when food was scarce and could not be preserved easily, it was adaptive to feast on rich foods when they were available _ Those who did so could build up fat and glycogen reserves, and thus were more likely to survive famines _ Today, in a changed environment, the same behaviors predispose us to obesity."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a13,"Our society’s main effort to overcome obesity has come in the form of dieting _ Diet fads constantly come and go — Atkins, South Beach, Acai Berry, the Hollywood diet, and pills, drinks, or even machines that purportedly melt away fat _ In fact, the total sales of weight loss services and products were estimated at over $55 billion in 2009 _ Unfortunately, all of this effort and expense does not appear to do much good _ Surveys, clinical trials, and literature reviews have repeatedly turned up a depressing pattern: about 80 percent of dieters regain lost weight within one to five years — and very often shoot past their prediet weight with each cycle."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a14,"If crash dieting is a bad idea, and we are “hardwired” to overeat, is there any hope for solving the obesity problem? Yes, there are many efforts in this direction."
transformations_energy_matter,metab_regulation_and_human_health_1a15," Medical approaches: For the extremely obese, surgical options that reduce the size of the stomach are often effective _ These procedures may work partly by reducing the stomach’s output of ghrelin, thus reducing the hunger pangs associated with an empty stomach _ Some drugs also show promise _ Behavior change: Much research is now exploring how different practices — emotional support groups, healthy cooking classes, and more — can help obese people make small, sustainable changes to their lifestyles for weight control and better health _ Societal change: Many are trying to reduce obesity by building parks and bike lanes, taxing snack foods and sugary sodas, changing school lunch menus, expanding physical education classes, posting calorie counts in restaurants, and much more _ These efforts are meant to change the overall social and physical environment to encourage more physical activity and less intake of calorie-rich foods _ "

transformations_energy_matter,_m3_pathways_regulation_quiz_wrapper3,The following key terms were discussed in this module:
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage1,"By the end of this module, students should be able to:"
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage2,"Glycolysis is the first pathway that occurs in the metabolism of carbohydrates _ This pathway occurs in the cytosol of all cells, i.e _ it is a highly conserved and ubiquitous pathway _ Although many different disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides and enter the glycolysis, we will focus on how glucose is metabolized in this section _ The entry points of other sugars will be discussed in the module on integrated metabolism _ "
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage3,An overall summary of glycolysis is depicted below:
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage4, Key features of Glycolysis: 
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage5," Glucose, a six carbon hexose, is the input compound _ Pyruvate, a three carbon keto-acid is the output _ There is no loss of carbon in glycolysis, so two pyruvates are produced/glucose _ Pyruvate is further oxidized in the TCA cycle _ Two ATP molecules are produced/glucose _ Note that the energy content of two ATP molecules is required to initiate the pathway _ Four ATP (2/pyruvate) are produced later in the pathway _ Consequently, the net yield is two ATP _ Two NADH molecules are produced _ A single oxidation step produces one molecule of NADH/pyruvate _ The energy stored in NADH is extracted during electron transport _ The key regulatory step is the addition of the second phosphate to fructose, by the enzyme phosphofructose kinase "
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage6,"Glucose from the outside of the cell is transported across the cell membrane by a multi-subunit protein called the glucose transporter _ This enzyme catalyzes the diffusion of glucose across the membrane without the input of energy _ Consequently, spontaneous flow of glucose into the cell can only occur if the concentration of glucose is lower in the cell than outside the cell _ The Gibbs free energy for the transport of glucose is:"
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage7,"Although this expression for the Gibbs free energy appears different than previous expressions, it is really the same equation _ The ""product"" of the reaction is glucose inside the cell and the ""reactant"" is glucose outside the cell _ The difference in standard free energy, Go, is zero because the reactants and products are the same compound, differing only in their location _ If the concentration of glucose outside the cell is higher than the concentration inside the cell, then the Gibbs free energy is negative (the ln of a number less than one is negative) and glucose will spontaneously enter the cell _ If the glucose concentration in both compartments are the same, then =0 and there is no net movement of glucose across the membrane _ If the concentration of glucose inside the cell exceeds the concentration outside then >0 and the reverse reaction, the net movement of glucose out of the cell, will be spontaneous."
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage8," The levels of glucose in the blood vary considerably at times _ We will discuss how glucose levels are regulated in the section on integrated metabolism _ The focus here is to understand how the entry of glucose into the cell is spontaneous, even when the levels of glucose in the blood can drop to low values _ How is it possible to maintain a negative Gibbs free energy for glucose transport into the cell, even if there are low levels of glucose outside the cell?

transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage9,Instructions: Compare the behavior of the two simulations to see how the Hexose Kinase molecule changes the concentration of glucose inside and outside of the cell.
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage10,"The following learn-by-doing activity allows you to investigate the chemical and energetic changes that occur in glycolysis _ Once you open up the page, explore it using the embedded questions to prepare you for the self-assessment at the end of this module."
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage11,Instructions: The left panel shows the energy changes that occur for each of the ten steps in glycolysis in the absence of coupling _ The right panel shows the actual energy changes during the normal operation of glycolysis _ These energy changes include contributions from both direct and indirect coupling _ Click on any of the red labeled steps on the left to see the details of that step in the glycolysis pathway _ You may also explore this activity in a separate larger window 
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage12," Under anaerobic (oxygen limited) conditions, which occurs in the muscle tissue during vigorous activity, the NADH produced in glycolysis cannot be reoxidized to NAD+ by electron transport because there is insufficient oxygen to accept electrons _ Under these conditions, the cell runs out of NAD+ and glycolysis will halt and the cell can no longer produce ATP _ "
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage13,"The levels of NAD+ can be restored by using pyruvate as the electron acceptor _ In mammals, lactate is the product of this reaction _ In yeast, it is alcohol and the process of anaerobic glycolysis is referred to as fermentation _ The reduction of pyruvate will oxidize NADH to NAD+, allowing glycolysis to resume."
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage14,"The lactate that is produced by active muscle tissue is transported to the liver _ When oxygen becomes available, the lactate is reoxidized to pyruvate and it can then be used for the synthesis of glucose."
transformations_energy_matter,glycolysispage15, The following quiz will be graded and recorded in the grade book _ You may take this quiz only once.
transformations_energy_matter,tca1,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle, is a central pathway in the metabolism of all organisms _ Not only is this pathway the next step for the oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, it also plays a key role in amino acid metabolism _ All carbons that enter the TCA cycle, regardless of their source, are fully oxidized to carbon dioxide _ The electrons that are released from these oxidations are stored on NADH and FADH2 for subsequent processing by the electron transport chain."
transformations_energy_matter,tca2,"Entry of carbohydrates into the TCA cycle occurs by the transport of pyruvate from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix _ There, the pyruvate undergoes a process called oxidative decarboxylation to produce a key intermediate in metabolism, acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle _ "
transformations_energy_matter,tca3,"Entry of fatty acids into the TCA occurs directly into acetyl-CoA _ During the process of fatty acid oxidation (beta-oxidation) which also occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, two-carbon fragments are progressively released from fatty acids and incorporated into acetyl-CoA."
transformations_energy_matter,tca4,The first step of the TCA cycle utilizes the high-energy thioester in acetyl-CoA to drive the addition of an acetate group to oxaloacetic acid to produce citrate.
transformations_energy_matter,tca5,The remaining steps in the TCA cycle convert citrate back to oxaloacetate _ This process produces:
transformations_energy_matter,tca6," 2 CO2, from oxidative decarboxylations _ 3 NADH, all from oxidation of alcohols to ketones _ 1 FADH2, from the oxidation of an alkane to an alkene 1 GTP, from the hydrolysis of a thio-ester _ "

transformations_energy_matter,tca10,What major metabolite is missing from this list? Carbohydrates! It is not possible for mammals to use carbon atoms derived from the TCA cycle to synthesize glucose _ How glucose is synthesized from pyruvate will be discussed in the module on integrated metabolism.
transformations_energy_matter,tca11,"If compounds in the TCA cycle are used to synthesize other compounds, such as amino acids, the TCA cycle will eventually halt due to depletion of oxaloacetate _ Consequently it is necessary to ""fill up"" the TCA cycle with an ""anaplerotic"" reaction _ In this case, pyruvate is converted to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos1,"By the end of this module, students should be able to:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos2,"The production of ATP from ""high-energy"" electrons on NADH and FADH2 occurs in two steps, electron transport followed by ATP synthesis _ The energy obtained from electron transport is stored as a pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane _ The combination of a concentration difference of hydrogen ions and a voltage difference accross this membrane is often referred to as an electrochemical gradient _ The electrochemical gradient is a form of potential energy that is utilized by the enzyme ATP synthase to convert ADP to ATP _ The coupling between the proton gradient and the chemical synthesis of ATP, was originally proposed by Dr _ Peter Michell in 1961 as the chemiosmotic hypothesis _ His theory proved to be true, leading to a Nobel prize for his work in 1978 _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos3," The electron transport chain consists of four multi-protein complexes that are contained within the inner mitochondrial membrane _ These complexes remove electrons from NADH or FADH2 molecules that were generated by oxidative processes in glycolysis and the TCA cycle _ These high energy compounds ultimately deposit their electrons on oxygen, forming water _ The energy that is released by electron transport is stored as a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane _ This proton gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP."
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos4,Various compounds are used by the electron transport chain to carry electrons _ These components include:
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos5," FAD/FADH2, is a cofactor that is tightly bound to the enzymes in the electron transport complexes _ Iron-sulfur centers in the electron transport complexes shuttle electrons by alternating between Fe+2 and Fe+3 _ Coenzyme Q is an organic non-polar electron carrier that is dissolved within the membrane lipids of the inner mitochondrial membrane _ It carries electrons between complex I and III and complex II and III _ Cytochrome C is a heme containing protein that is very similar in structure to myoglobin _ It is a water soluble protein found in the inter-membrane space _ Cytochrome C carries one electron at a time from complex III to complex IV _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos6,The organization of the four complexes and electron carriers in the electron transport chain are illustrated in the following diagram:
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos7,"NADH is oxidized by the electron transport chain by the transfer of the two electrons from NADH to complex I _ These electrons are then transferred to coenzyme Q, followed by transfer to complex III _ The electrons are then carried by cytochrome C to complex IV, where the electrons are used to reduce oxygen to water _ The energy that is released by the transfer of electrons from NADH to water is used to transport a total of 10 protons across the inner membrane _ For every pair of electrons, four protons are transported by complex I, four by complex II and two by complex IV _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos8,"The electrons from FADH2 are first processed by complex II _ Complex II is actually succinate dehydrogenase from the TCA cycle _ The electron acceptor for succinate, FAD, is tightly bound to the enzyme _ Consequently, it is more correct to consider that complex II processes the electrons from succinate, first passing them to FAD and then via iron-sulfur centers to coenzyme Q _ The two electrons then follow the same path as those from NADH2, from coenzyme Q to complex III, and then to complex IV via cytochrome C, finally to oxygen to produce water _ Since electron transport through complex II does not result in the transport of protons only a total of 6 protons/2 electrons are transported across the inner membrane when succinate is the initial electron donor."
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos9,In summary:
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos10," Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred to oxygen, generating water _ Electron transport is spontaneous and releases energy _ This energy is stored by transporting protons across the inner membrane _ Oxidation of NADH results in 10 protons transported across the inner membrane _ Oxidation of FADH2 results in 6 protons transported across the inner membrane _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos11," The energy that has been stored in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane cannot be easily utilized by other processes in the cell _ It must be converted to a more usable source, such as ATP _ The enzyme ATP synthase is responsible for converting the energy stored in the proton gradient to ATP _ This enzyme is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and it projects into the matrix."
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos12,"The mechanism of ATP synthase is such that the enzyme generates one ATP molecule every time 3 protons are transferred back to the matrix from the inter-membrane space _ Since the standard energy for the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi is +30 kJ/mol the transport of three protons must release at least 30kJ/mol in order to provide enough energy to synthesize ATP _ The amount of energy that is stored in the protein gradient can be obtained by calculating the Gibbs free energy _ If the products are defined as the protons that have been transported to the matrix, the formula is:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos13,"where Z is the change on the transported particle, F is Faraday's constant (96,494 Coulomb/mol) and is the voltage difference across the membrane:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos14,The Gibbs free energy consists of two terms _ The first indicates the energy change due to the difference of proton concentration across the membrane _ Its form is analogous to the formula give for the transport of glucose across the membrane in glycolysis _ The second term accounts for the fact that the energy of a charged particle depends on the voltage _ If there is a voltage difference across the membrane then the energy of the proton will depend on its location.
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos15,"Typical proton concentration differences across the inner membrane are approximately 10 fold, with the outside being more acidic _ In addition to the concentration difference, there is also an approximately 100 mV voltage difference across the membrane, with the inside being more negative _ Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change under these conditions at 300 K is:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos16,"Therefore the transport of 3 protons will release 45.9 kJ/mol, which is more than sufficient to generate a single ATP."
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos17, The synthesis of ATP utilizing the proton gradient as a source of energy is an example of direct coupling _ The energy released as the protons flow through the enzyme cause a conformational change in the protein that causes the formation of ATP from bound ADP and inorganic phosphate _ 
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos18," The enzyme consists of two separable subunits _ The Fo subunit is within the membrane and is responsible for the transfer of protons through the membrane _ The F1 subunit extends into the mitochondrial matrix and is responsible for the synthesis of ATP _ The F1 subunit is composed of three subunits and three subunits _ These six subunits from a spherical structure where the and subunits alternate _ The subunit extends from the Fo domain through the center of the - sphere _ The subunit rotates 120 degrees every time three protons flows through the Fo domain _ The - sphere is prevented from rotating along with the subunit by the b-subunit, which anchors the - sphere to the membrane."
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos19,"The conformation of the - subunits is affected by the relative position of the subunit _ Since the gamma subunit rotates 120o, there are three possible conformations of the - subunits:"
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos20," A conformation that has low affinity of nucleotides, i.e _ neither ATP or ADP bind _ A conformation that has high affinity for ADP plus inorganic phosphate _ A conformation that has high affinity for ATP, i.e _ ATP is more stable in this conformation than ADP _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos21,The cycle of ATP synthesis is as follows:
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos22," ADP and inorganic phosphate bind to the subunits that have high affinity for these compounds _ A three protons flow through the Fo domain, causing a 120o rotation of the -subunit _ The rotation of the -subunit causes a conformational change in the - subunits _ ATP is more stable in the new conformation of the - subunits, consequently the bound ADP and inorganic phosphate is spontaneously converted to ATP _ Another three protons flow through the Fo domain, causing another 120o rotation of the subunit _ This rotation causes an additional conformational change of the - subunits, generating the conformation that has low affinity for ATP and ADP, thus the newly synthesized ATP is released _ A three additional protons flows through the Fo domain, causing another rotation of subunits _ This restores the system to the starting conditions _ "
transformations_energy_matter,etrans_oxphos23,"Complete rotation of the subunit requires the transfer of 9 protons across the membrane _ This generates a total of 3 ATP molecules since there are three ADP/ATP binding sites on the F1 domain, one associated with each - subunit _ Consequently, only three protons are required to synthesize one ATP."

struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_22,"Proteins are macromolecules built from amino acids _ There are many different types of proteins, and each type has a special function to perform in living organisms _ This specialized function is determined largely by the types of amino acids that are in the protein _ There are 20 different amino acids that can be joined in a myriad of ways to produce molecules with an enormous variety of possible structures that can perform a huge number of critical cellular functions _ The following list represents just a sampling of the many things proteins can do in living systems."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_23," Proteins can catalyze chemical reactions by accelerating the rate at which chemical reactions take place in the cell _ Proteins that catalyze reactions are called enzymes _ Proteins play a role in the storage, replication, transmission, and regulation of genetic information (DNA) _ Some proteins bind to DNA and either reduce the expression of a gene, or activate the expression of a gene _ Proteins can help move substances in and out of the cell _ These proteins can be embedded in the cell membrane, where they act as transporters _ Some soluble proteins can transport materials throughout the body _ Hemoglobin is a protein that is found in high concentrations in red blood cells _ Hemoglobin carries oxygen from our lungs to our tissues _ Proteins can recognize specific molecules _ Protein receptors found in the lining of your nose recognize and bind to chemicals in the air, which triggers a message to the brain indicating the presence of a certain smell _ Proteins can facilitate mechanical movement _ Special proteins found in muscle cells use the energy in ATP to flex your muscles _ Proteins can help maintain structure in an organism _ The cellular cytoskeleton consists of proteins that form long fibrous scaffolding in cells that helps the cell maintain its shape _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_24,Some of the major types of proteins and their functions are summarized in the table below.
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_25,Take a look at this diagram to see even more ways that proteins are used in your body.
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_1rev1,"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins _ A protein is composed of a series of amino acids attached end-to-end via covalent bonds _ Consequently, a protein looks like a string of beads, with each bead representing an amino acid _ The bond between the amino acids is referred to as the peptide bond."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_1rev2,"An amino acid is a small organic chemical that is made up of four parts _ There is a nitrogen-containing amino group on one end of an amino acid _ The other end of an amino acid has a carboxylic acid group _ These two groups (the amino group and the carboxylic acid group) are the reason for the name “amino acid.” The amino and carboxylic acid groups are linked by a single carbon atom called the alpha carbon _ Finally, there is a variable “R group” also attached to the alpha carbon _ The amino acids differ in the nature of the R group that is attached to the central alpha carbon _ There are 20 different R groups commonly found in nature _ In this way, all amino acids are identical except for the different R groups (also called side chains) attached to the alpha carbon _ The properties of different proteins depend entirely on the sequence, or arrangement, of the amino acids."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_1rev3,There are many ways to represent an amino acid _ Take a look at some of the representations below _ 
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_1rev4," The main-chain atoms of glycine are highlighted in yellow and its side chain (H) is highlighted in green _ All amino acids have the same main-chain atoms, but differ in the side chains _ For clarity, the hydrogen is omitted in the remaining drawings _ Nonpolar amino acids are highlighted in gray, Aromatic amino acids are highlighted in cyan, Polar amino acids are highlighted in purple, Amino acids with acidic side chains are highlighted in red, and Amino acids with basic side chains are highlighted in blue _ The amino acids cysteine and proline, which are shown at the bottom of the page, have unique properties _ Cysteine can form covalent S-S disulfide bonds, stabilizing the protein structure _ In the case of proline, the side chain attaches to its own nitrogen, making proline an amino acid _ "

Initially, a 2D drawing of the simplest amino acid, glycine, is shown in the upper left and its 3D structure is shown on the right."
struc_fun,explanations_index1,The –carbon is the carbon attached to the carbonyl carbon _ Both of the alpha and carbonyl carbon are found in all amino acids _ .
struc_fun,explanations_index2,"Amino acids with acidic side chains contain a carboxyl group on the side chain _ At physiological pH, acidic groups loose proton (act as an acid) and become negatively charged."
struc_fun,explanations_index3,"Amino acids with a side chain that contains a ring structure with conjugated double bonds _ Conjugated double bonds refer to the alternating arrangement of bonds in a molecule: double-single-double bond _ The benzene ring is the best known example of an aromatic group _ Two amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, contain the benzene ring _ Aromatic rings can include atoms other than carbon."
struc_fun,explanations_index4,"Amino acids with basic side chains contain basic nitrogen-containing groups _ At physiological pH, basic groups gain a proton (acting as a base) and become positively charged."
struc_fun,explanations_index5,"Amino acids with non-polar side chains contain, primarily, hydrocarbons and no polar functional groups containing electronegative atoms _ Note that the term “nonpolar” refers only to the side chain, while the amino acid as a whole is charged at physiological pH due to the carboxyl and amino groups."
struc_fun,explanations_index6,"Amino acids with polar side chains contain polar uncharged groups, for example amide and hydroxyl."
struc_fun,func_groups_tutorial1,"The table below contains the functional groups organized based on properties and is rich with information and examples about each of the groups _ The functional groups are listed _ You can click on each group to see the chemical properties, as well as several examples of molecules, associated with that group _ The 3-D structure viewer is interactive; click and drag the structure to rotate it _ You can also use radio buttons to select groups of molecules to explore how the groups are related functionally _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2a1,"Proteins are built when amino acids are linked end-to-end by covalent bonds _ The covalent bonds that link amino acids are called peptide bonds _ A peptide bond is formed when the amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxylic acid of another amino acid _ After a peptide bond forms, the three conserved parts of the two amino acids (the nitrogen group, the alpha carbon and the carboxylic acid) are all linked, forming the main chain, or backbone, of the protein _ The variable side chains of each amino acid (the R groups) project out from the main chain _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2a2,"Two amino acids join to form a dipeptide _ Longer chains of connected amino acids are often called polypeptides _ When polypeptides are synthesized, new amino acids are added only to the carboxylic acid end of the existing chain _ A completed polypeptide is directional; it has two different ends _ One end has a free amino group, while the other end has a free carboxylic acid group _ When amino acids in a protein are counted, the numbering starts with the amino acid that has the free amino group _ The last amino acid is also the last one that was added when the chain was built: it has a free carboxylic acid group."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev1,"The order of the amino acids in a particular protein is determined by information encoded in the cell's genes, and the order of amino acids is referred to as the sequence of the protein _ An example of a protein sequence is shown below where the one-letter abbreviations are used for each of the 20 amino acids used in cellular protein synthesis _ By convention, the first amino acid is at the end with the free amino group and the last amino acid is at the end with the carboxylic acid group."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev2,"The linear chain of amino acids will spontaneously fold into a three-dimensional shape, which is usually the active form of the protein _ For example, look at the drawing of the three-dimensional structure of myoglobin (shown on the left) _ You can manipulate the 3D structure using the Jmol image on the right."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev3,"Many folded proteins bind small organic molecules that assist the protein in performing its function _ For example, the heme group in myoglobin (colored gray in the right image) is not part of the protein chain, but fits within a pocket in the myoglobin protein _ Myoglobin is responsible for binding oxygen in muscles _ Heme groups also are present in the oxygen transport protein, hemoglobin."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev4,"Proteins spontaneously fold to form their functional three-dimensional shape, reaching the lowest energy state, because this is the most stable state _ The folding process can be reversible, meaning that a folded protein can unfold and then refold _ However, unfolding can also be irreversible, where the unfolded protein chains tangle with each other, forming an aggregate and precipitating out of solution _ This is often referred to as a denatured state _ Conditions that cause proteins to unfold and denature are extremes of temperature and pH _ Cooking denatures proteins by heating so they unfold and denature _ The same effect occurs when proteins are exposed to the low pH in your stomach _ This helps your body digest the proteins found in your food, and it helps kill ingested bacteria and viruses."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev5,"Although many factors stabilize the final shape of a protein, the most important factor is the hydrophobic effect _ Amino acids with nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains are driven into the central core of the protein because they are repelled by the water _ This is known as the hydrophobic effect, and it results in proteins that have amino acids with hydrophilic side chains on the surface of the protein _ The folded protein reaches the lowest energy state, which is the most stable, by folding in a way that will optimize the burial of nonpolar amino acid side chains while still leaving the polar groups on the surface _ Therefore, the shape of the folded form of the protein depends on the order of the hydrophobic amino acids in the protein."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_2b_rev6,"Consider a short 12 amino acid protein consisting of polar (white) and nonpolar (black) amino acids _ This polypeptide will fold to bury most of the nonpolar amino acids, removing them from contact with water, giving the lowest energy state _ Other structures are possible, but these will be higher energy (and consequently less stable) because they expose more nonpolar amino acid side chains to water."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_31,"The biological function of most proteins involves binding to something else _ The binding event may be the first step in transport, signaling, regulation, or an enzyme-catalyzed reaction _ Molecules that bind to proteins without being modified are called ligands _ Although ligands are usually small molecules, they can also be larger than the protein to which they are binding _ For example, when proteins bind to DNA, it is the DNA that is the ligand _ Oxygen is a ligand when it binds to hemoglobin (a protein) during oxygen transport to the tissues _ Molecules found on the surface of bacterial cells are ligands when antibodies (proteins) in your blood bind to them during an immune response _ Sometimes ligands are given special names to remind us of their function _ For example: enzyme inhibitors are ligands that bind to and inhibit enzymes; antigens are ligands that are recognized by antibodies (which are proteins)."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_32,The ligand binds to the protein by interacting with amino acids in the protein’s binding site _ Binding proteins have binding sites for their ligand (L) _ 
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_33,"Binding proteins have amino acids in their binding site that are complementary to the ligand _ Generally, a higher degree of complementarity leads to tighter binding and a more specific interaction _ The molecules can be complementary in these different ways:"
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_34," The shape of the ligand matches the shape of the ligand binding pocket on the protein _ The better the match, the stronger the bond between the ligand and the protein _ Any charges on the ligand molecule can be aligned close to opposite charges on the protein's binding site _ Remember, opposite charges attract each other _ Hydrogen bonds often form between the ligand and the protein binding site _ Nonpolar ligands bind more favorably to nonpolar surfaces on the protein _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_35,"The interactions between proteins and their ligands are incredibly diverse, but they all share some basic ground rules _ Protein-ligand binding is:"
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_36," Reversible — bound ligands can be released by the protein _ Concentration dependent — the level of binding depends on the ligand concentration _ As the ligand concentration increases, so does the amount of protein bound _ Limited — once all of the proteins are ligand bound, no additional ligand can bind and the protein is said to be saturated _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_3d1,"In all chemical reactions, there is an initial input of energy that is required before the reaction can occur _ If this initial energy requirement (called the activation energy or energy barrier) is small, then the reaction will happen quickly and easily _ If the activation energy is large, then the reaction will take longer to occur _ Enzymes function to reduce the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_3d2,"First, the enzyme binds to the substrate and slightly distorts its shape _ The change in shape activates the substrate molecule and decreases the total activation energy required for the substrate to be turned into product _ As the number of activated substrate molecules increases, so does the conversion of substrate to product _ An analogy for this effect is a ski hill, with skiers at the bottom of one side of the hill representing substrates, skiers on the top of the hill representing activated substrates, and the products being the number of skiers that ski down the other side _ If the height of the hill is lowered (due to the presence of the enzyme), then more skiers can make it to the top, increasing the number that ski down to become products."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_3e1,"The activity of an enzyme (its ability to convert substrate to product), depends on a number of parameters that are listed below _ Many of these parameters can help control the activities of enzymes to optimize the utilization of cellular resources."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_3e2," Temperature: As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the substrate molecules increases, allowing more substrate molecules to become activated and increasing the reaction rate _ This is equivalent to more skiers having the energy to surmount the activation energy and reach the top of the hill _ Many enzymes have optimal activity at the temperature of the organism _ However, there is a limit to how much you can increase the rate of the reaction by changing the temperature _ If the temperature is too high, the enzyme unfolds, denatures, and becomes inactive _ pH: Protein structure can be affected by the pH of the solution surrounding it _ If a protein group that is important for substrate binding or catalysis can be protonated or deprotonated, then changing the pH is likely to affect the enzyme activity _ Different enzymes are functional at different pH levels _ Pepsin is a digestive enzyme secreted by the stomach lining that is activated by the low pH in the stomach _ Salivary amylase, on the other hand, is denatured and nonfunctional in the stomach environment _ Substrate concentration: As the substrate concentration increases, the number of substrate molecules that bind to the enzyme also increases _ This leads to increased substrate activation _ Presence of inhibitors: Inhibitors can reduce the activity of enzymes through two different mechanisms _ Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site and prevent the substrate from attaching to the binding site _ Since less substrate can bind to the enzyme, the activity is reduced _ Noncompetitive inhibitors (also called mixed-type) do not bind to the active site, but bind elsewhere on the enzyme _ However, the bound inhibitor changes the shape of the active site, reducing the activity of the enzyme _ Drugs to treat disease often inhibit enzyme activity _ For example, one of the drugs used to treat HIV is a competitive inhibitor of a specific viral enzyme, while another anti-HIV drug is a noncompetitive inhibitor of a different viral enzyme _ Presence of activators: Activators, like noncompetitive inhibitors, also change the shape of the active site by binding elsewhere on the enzyme, but in this case the enzyme is converted from an inactive form to an active form _ In this way, activators increase enzyme activity _ "
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_spotlight1,"Lactase is an example of an enzyme that breaks large molecules down into smaller ones _ Lactase is produced in the intestinal tract of mammals and breaks the sugar in milk, lactose, into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose _ The monosaccharides can then be metabolized to produce energy."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_spotlight2,"Lactase breaks lactose into galactose and glucose by adding a water molecule to the bond between the two sugars _ Without adequate lactase, ingested lactose from milk and cheese is not broken down, and therefore cannot be absorbed in the small intestine _ Instead, the lactose goes to the large intestine, where it is eaten by bacteria that live there _ After metabolizing the lactose, the bacteria produce large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which results in significant discomfort for the individual lacking lactase."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_spotlight3,"Unfortunately, as many individuals age, their ability to produce lactase is diminished _ This is especially true for individuals from Asian, African, Native American, or Mediterranean descent _ The incidence of lactose intolerance is lower for those of European descent _ Approximately one in seven American adults suffer from lactose intolerance, and African Americans can show signs of lactose intolerance as early as two years of age."
struc_fun,acids_and_proteins_spotlight4,"These individuals are lactose intolerant and should avoid eating foods with high lactose content, such as milk _ Milk products, such as buttermilk, yogurt, and cheese, cause less of a problem because the amount of lactose in these products is reduced by the microorganisms that are used to make them _ Lactose intolerant individuals can consume milk under certain conditions _ "

phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_11,"Lipids are a diverse group of macromolecules united by their hydrophobic, nonpolar nature _ We are most familiar with the lipids known as fats _ Fats are used to store energy for later use _ They also provide structural support and cushioning for many animals _ Some dietary fats are healthier than others _ In this module, you will learn about the differences between saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_12,"People are most familiar with fats, but there are types of lipids that are not fats _ Cholesterol is a familiar example of a lipid that is not actually a fat _ You will learn more about cholesterol in this module as well."
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_13,"Lipids include a distinct group of compounds that are united by two common features _ First, they are largely nonpolar in nature _ This is because they are hydrocarbons that include many nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds _ Second, because lipids are nonpolar, they are also hydrophobic (water-hating), or insoluble in water."
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_14,"Lipids perform many different functions in a cell _ Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats _ Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals _ For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry because of their hydrophobic nature _ Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of the cell’s plasma membrane _ Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids _ The table below summarizes the charateristics of lipids _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_15,"Because lipids are such a diverse group of biomolecules, we will study them in four categories _ Examine the following table for a general understanding of lipid structure and function."
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_21,"Waxes are nonpolar lipids that form protective layers on plants and animals _ For example, waxes cover the feathers of some aquatic birds to keep the feathers dry _ Plants, on the other hand, often have leaves coated with waxes to prevent water from evaporating off the plant surface _ Because of their hydrophobic nature, waxes prevent water from sticking on the surface of these structures."
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_22,"The chemical structure of a wax is linked to its function _ Waxes are the simplest lipids in nature, consisting of two long hydrocarbon chains linked in the middle by an ester group _ It is this structure that enables waxes to function the way they do in living systems _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_2b1,Steroids are a family of lipids based on a molecular structure with four fused carbon rings _ This family of lipids includes many hormones and cholesterol _ Hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone) are used by some animals as long-distance messengers _ This means that they are produced by cells in one part of the body and affect cells in a different part of the body.
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_2b2,"Cholesterol is an example of a familiar steroid that plays many important roles in your body _ While most people are familiar with cholesterol, they often don’t realize how important it is for healthy function _ In fact, most of the cholesterol in your body is synthesized by your liver _ Cholesterol has many functions _ Cholesterol is used to build steroid hormones, including testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the sex organs _ Cholesterol is also the precursor to vitamins D and K _ Some cholesterol is converted to bile salts, which help in the absorption of fats from the digestive system into the body _ Cholesterol is also used by animals to maintain the proper consistency of the cell membrane, which is the structure that surrounds every cell _ Other organisms use different steroids for this function _ For example, plants use a steroid called stigmasterol, while fungi use ergosterol _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_11,"Fats and oils are called triglycerides because they are made of three (“tri”) fatty acids attached to one glycerol _ A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid, a charged polar functional group, that contains a long hydrocarbon chain _ The fatty acids are usually 16 to 22 carbons long, but can range from 4 to 36 carbons in length _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_12,"Fats are mainly energy storage and insulating molecules _ Per gram, fats contain twice as much energy as carbohydrates _ Layers of fat also surround the vital organs of animals to help cushion and protect them _ In some animals, layers of fat under the skin provide insulation _ This is particularly true of marine endotherms (i.e., organisms that maintain internal body temperature using their own metabolism) that live in cold polar regions, like penguins, whales, and seals _ These are all examples of animals with thick insulating “blubber” beneath the skin _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_13,"In one triglyceride there are three fatty acids _ All of these can be the same, or there can be two or three different types of fatty acids in a single triglyceride _ The fat’s properties depend on the types of fatty acids that are present."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_14,"In saturated fatty acids, all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds and each carbon is bonded to two or three H atoms; each carbon is “saturated” with hydrogen _ Because all the bonds are single, the entire fatty acid can adopt a linear shape _ Unsaturated fatty acids have one, two, or even three double bonds along the carbon “backbone.” Notice in the diagram below that at each double bond, the carbons involved are bonded to only one instead of two hydrogen atoms _ Thus these fatty acids have less hydrogen; they are “unsaturated” with respect to hydrogen _ The double bonds found in the unsaturated fatty acids have an effect on the overall shape of a triglyceride: unsaturated fatty acids are normally “kinked,” because the double bond prevents free rotation between the two carbons involved."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_15,"Saturated fats have three saturated fatty acid “tails” — all of which are linear in shape _ With their compact shape, saturated fat molecules pack together efficiently and form a solid at room temperature _ These are usually produced by animals; everyday examples of saturated fats include lard and real butter _ Unsaturated fats have at least one unsaturated fatty acid _ With their “kinky” fatty acid(s), unsaturated fats will not pack into a regular structure and thus remain fluid at room temperature _ They are called oils, and are commonly produced by plants; everyday examples include olive oil, corn oil, and canola oil."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_1b1,"A diet rich in saturated fats may contribute to formation of plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increase your risk of heart disease _ To reduce this risk, it is recommended that you replace some foods rich in saturated fats (e.g _ fatty cuts of pork, beef, and high-fat dairy products like butter) with foods that provide unsaturated fats (available in foods like olive oil, canola oil, seafood, and walnuts) _ Such a shift is believed to help improve blood cholesterol levels and may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_1b2,"In the diagram above, you see the physical behavior of two different triglycerides (with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) at three distinct temperatures _ Figure 1 shows that at a temperature of 0oC (freezing), both types of fatty acids stack neatly _ At 16oC (Fig _ 2), the unsaturated fatty acids lose the tightly stacked formation and become more mobile _ At 70oC, the saturated fatty acids also become mobile (Fig.3) _ At 27oC (room temperature) and at 37oC (body temperature), triglycerides with unsaturated fatty acids are liquid oils, whereas saturated fats remain solid _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_1b3,"Since the early 20th century, modified vegetable oils have been produced that are solid at room temperature _ Examples include margarine and vegetable shortening _ To make these products, a chemical process is used to add hydrogen to vegetable oil _ Many of the double bonds in the fatty acids are replaced by single bonds (and hydrogen atoms), but some double bonds remain in the partially hydrogenated oils that result _ This process increases shelf-life and produces flaky rather than crumbly crusts when used for baking _ As a side effect of the chemical transformation, the orientation of some of the remaining double bonds is shifted _ The naturally occurring double bonds are converted to trans double bonds, making ""trans fats."" "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_triglycerides_1b4,"Historically, it was believed that synthetic trans unsaturated fats would be as “good for you” as natural unsaturated fats _ However, recent studies have shown that consumption of trans fat may pose a significant health risk _ Consuming a lot of trans fat can lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) _ This in turn is associated with a higher risk of heart disease _ Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and many products have been reformulated so that they are much lower in trans fats _ However, trans fats are still a common ingredient in many processed foods; close reading of ingredient and nutrition labels is recommended _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_phospholipids_11,"Phospholipids are an important class of lipids found in the membranes of all cells and organelles _ A phospholipid contains only two fatty acids attached to a glycerol, which in turn is bound to a phosphate group _ Together, the phosphate and the glycerol make up the “head” of the phospholipid _ The fatty acids make up the molecule’s “tail.” The phosphate group carries a negative charge and is therefore hydrophilic _ The tail, on the other hand, is made up of nonpolar fatty acids and, like other lipids, is hydrophobic _ Thus phospholipids, like fatty acids, are amphipathic _ An amphipathic molecule has both a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_phospholipids_1b1,"Remember that hydrophilic molecules dissolve in water and hydrophobic ones do not _ But phospholipids have a “split personality” in this regard _ How do they behave in water? When small numbers of phospholipids are in an aqueous solution they will self-assemble into micelles, structures that exclude water molecules from the hydrophobic tails while keeping the hydrophilic head in contact with the aqueous solution _ If enough phospholipids are present, they will form a bilayer _ This is the favored formation because it is the most stable orientation for phospholipids in a water solution _ View the animation that demonstrates the formation of micelles and bilayers."
phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_phospholipids_1b2,"With their “split personality,” phospholipids are able to play a very important role in biology _ Phospholipids, together with other molecules in smaller quantities, form membranes that surround the cell and intracellular organelles such as mitochondria _ The cell membrane is a fluid, semipermeable bilayer that separates the cell's contents from the environment _ See animation below _ "
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_2c1,"Although some cholesterol is essential for healthy physiological functioning, excess cholesterol can lead to health problems _ Because cholesterol is hydrophobic, it cannot be easily transported through the body in the blood stream _ A carrier is required to transport cholesterol around the body to the cells that need it _ These carriers are called lipoproteins _ You can think of lipoproteins as cholesterol boats that carry cholesterol to the body’s cells (where it can be used to build or repair cell membranes or synthesize steroid hormones) _ Lipoproteins that carry cholesterol to the cell for use are called low-density lipoproteins (or LDL) _ LDL is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, because excess LDL levels have been linked to plaque deposition in the arteries, which can result in heart disease _ Another type of lipoprotein, known as high-density lipoprotein (or HDL) transports cholesterol to the liver, where it is often turned into bile salts and excreted _ HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol, because high blood concentrations of HDL have been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease _ Exercise and proper diet can increase HDL levels _ Increasing intake of unsaturated fats and decreasing intake of saturated fats is also a good strategy for increasing HDL levels."
phys_prop_cell,bc_Lipids_introduction_2c2,"Given what you know about the function and structure of cholesterol, why would deposits within the arteries be bad? Examine the table below providing interpretation of cholesterol numbers including LDL and HDL."

phys_prop_cell,bc_lipids_phospholipids_1d2,"Lipids are essential to life _ Phospholipids form the bulk of cell membranes, which define the cell _ Steroids can be used to help maintain proper membrane fluidity and are used as long-distance messenger molecules in some animals _ Triglycerides are an excellent source of energy storage for organisms _ Maintaining proper lipid levels is also essential to human health _ A deeper understanding of the chemistry and physiology of these molecules can help us develop a better understanding of ourselves."

phys_prop_cell,_u3_m1_cell_structure_0rev4,"In this unit, you will learn about the cell and all the parts that make it functional _ You will also focus on the cell membrane, which is the structure that surrounds the cell and separates its internal environment from the external environment _ This separation enables the cell to maintain homeostasis and exhibit the emergent property of life."
phys_prop_cell,biochem_organic_unit_intro_v11,"In the Introduction to Chemistry unit, you learned that atoms are the building blocks of all matter _ You also learned that atoms can be linked together with chemical bonds, to form molecules that have their own unique properties _ In this unit, you will take a closer look at a special group of molecules that form the backbone of living structures: the biological macromolecules _ Biological macromolecules are special molecules that contain carbon atoms covalently bonded with hydrogen atoms _ "
phys_prop_cell,biochem_organic_unit_intro_v12,"There are four classes of biological macromolecules that we will study in this course: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids _ These macromolecules are probably already familiar to you, because they make up the nutrients you ingest every time you eat _ In this way, you provide your cells with the building materials and energy necessary to sustain life _ In the next unit, we will use these fundamental building blocks to form the cell, the first level of organization that shows all the characteristics of life _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_11,"The cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, is the boundary of the cell; it determines what enters and exits the cell, and it is how the cell interacts with its environment _ Have you ever looked closely at the colors swirling in a soap bubble? This may give you a feel for the fluid nature of a cell's membrane _ A membrane's components are in constant motion, as if they were flowing in a river _ A variety of different proteins, carbohydrates, sterols, and other molecules are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer _ This gives the impression of a tile mosaic, which has variously shaped and colored tiles embedded in grout _ Because of its fluidity and its variety, biologists currently describe the cell membrane as a fluid mosaic _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_12,"The phospholipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane _ The bilayer's structure causes the membrane to be semipermeable _ The hydrophobic core blocks the diffusion of hydrophilic ions and polar molecules _ Small hydrophobic molecules and gases, which can dissolve in the membrane's core, cross it with ease _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_13,"Other molecules require proteins to transport them across the membrane _ Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions _ The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each have unique collections of proteins _ For example, to date more than 50 kinds of proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_14,"What is important about the structure of a phospholipid membrane? First, it is fluid _ This allows cells to change shape, permitting growth and movement _ The fluidity of the membrane is regulated by the types of phospholipids and the presence of cholesterol _ Second, the phospholipid membrane is selectively permeable _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_15,"The ability of a molecule to pass through the membrane depends on its polarity and to some extent its size _ Many nonpolar molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small hydrocarbons can flow easily through cell membranes _ This feature of membranes is very important because hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in your blood, is contained within red blood cells _ Oxygen must be able to freely cross the membrane so that hemoglobin can get fully loaded with oxygen in your lungs, and deliver it effectively to your tissues _ Most polar substances are stopped by a cell membrane, except perhaps for small polar compounds like one-carbon alcohol, methanol, and water _ Glucose is too large to pass through the membrane unassisted and a special transporter protein ferries it across _ Certain types of diabetes are caused by misregulation of the glucose transporter _ Charged ions, such as sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+) ions seldom go through a membrane; consequently, they also need special transporter molecules to pass through the membrane _ The inability of Na+ and K+ to pass through the membrane allows the cell to regulate the concentrations of these ions on the inside or outside of the cell _ The conduction of electrical signals in your nerves is based on the ability of cells to control Na+ and K+ levels _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_16,Selectively permeable membranes allow cells to keep the chemistry of the cytoplasm different from that of the external environment _ It also allows them to maintain chemically unique conditions inside their organelles _ 
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1b_rev1,The cell membrane must be a dynamic structure if the cell is to grow and respond to environmental changes _ The fluidity of the membrane is demonstrated in the following animation _ 
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1b_rev2," To keep their membranes fluid across a range of temperatures, cells alter the composition of their membranes _ Phospholipids with differing fatty acid tails have different levels of mobility in the membrane _ The right ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids keeps the membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life _ For example, winter wheat responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes _ The unsaturated fatty acid tails keep membranes fluid because they are kinked and resistant to packing _ In animal cells, the membrane is made up of mostly saturated fatty acids, so it is relatively stable (not too fluid) _ Cholesterol plays a key role in keeping animal cell membranes fluid across a range of temperatures _ At high temperatures, cholesterol molecules interfere with phospholipid movement and reduce membrane fluidity _ At low temperatures, cholesterol keeps the saturated fatty acid tails from packing and maintains adequate fluidity _ Other sterols play a similar role in the cell membranes of plants, fungi, and even some prokaryotes _ Fungi, for example, use ergosterol _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev1,"The cellular or plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer composed of phospholipids and associated proteins, specialized lipids, and carbohydrates _ The composition of the plasma membrane varies according to the type and function of the cell."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev2,Sterols are used by some cells to maintain proper membrane fluidity.
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev3,"The extracellular surface of the cell membrane is decorated with carbohydrate groups attached to lipids and proteins _ These short carbohydrates play a role in giving a cell its identity (i.e., distinguishing self from nonself) and are the distinguishing factor in human blood types."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev4,"Membranes also contain proteins, which carry out many of the functions of the membrane _ Some functions of membrane proteins are:"
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev5," Transport _ Because the plasma membrane is only semipermeable, the cell needs a way to transport larger materials into and out of the cell _ Communication _ Because the plasma membrane is the border of the cell, this is where the cell communicates with its environment _ Membrane proteins are able to receive signals from outside the cell and begin a chain of events that cause the cell to respond to these signals _ Metabolism _ Membrane proteins can be enzymes that are involved in the chemical reactions of metabolism _ These are the processes that allow the cell to grow, obtain energy, and eliminate wastes _ Adhesion _ Membrane proteins help cells bind to each other and form tissues _ One example of this is skin cells, which must form a tight surface if the skin is to maintain proper integrity _ Membrane proteins also bind to molecules inside and outside the cell, which helps the cell maintain its structure _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1d_rev6,"In order to carry out their functions, some proteins need to be embedded in the membrane _ These proteins are called integral proteins (“integral” because they are “integrated” into the membrane) _ For example, a membrane protein that transports materials into or out of the cell needs to completely span the membrane _ On the other hand, a protein that binds the cell to another can simply be attached to the outer surface of the membrane _ Proteins that are attached to the inner or outer surface of a membrane are called peripheral proteins _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1e1,"Prokaryotes are an enormously diverse group of organisms _ However, they can be organized into two primary groups: bacteria and archaea _ While both bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes (both groups lack nuclei), the archaeans have some interesting structural characteristics in the cell membrane that have unique functional significance."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1e2,"The cell membranes found in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells consist of a phospholipid bilayer that separates the internal environment of the cell from its external environment and regulates the materials that pass in and out of the cell _ This enables the cell to maintain internal homeostasis, regardless of changing external conditions _ You already know that cell membranes can be structurally different, to enable different functions _ For example, some bacteria live in the frozen Arctic Circle _ They are able to maintain membrane fluidity because of an increased concentration of unsaturated fatty acid tails found within the membrane phospholipids."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1e3,"Archaeans are often found living in extreme environments such as high temperature, pH, or salinity, and as such, are often called “extremophiles” (loving extreme conditions) _ How can their cell membranes stay intact in such conditions? The cell membrane must have a unique structure to withstand these conditions."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1e4,"You will explore characteristics of the archaean cell membrane in the following activities _ First, you need to orient yourself to the phospholipid found in a bacterial cell _ You might want to review the structure of phospholipids _ "
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane-convert_1e5,You figured out that the structure of the archaean phospholipid is significantly different from the structure of the bacterial phospholipid _ These structural differences lead to functional differences that enable archaeans to survive in extreme environments _ This is an excellent example of how structure determines function at the cellular level of organization.
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane_mod_summary1,"Membranes are the defining characteristic of a cell in the same way that your skin distinguishes what is ""you"" from what is ""not you."" Like your skin, the membrane interacts with the environment and controls what gets in and what gets out _ However, additional features (such as eyes and a mouth) are necessary for more complex interactions with the environment _ Similarly, proteins in the membrane further help the membrane control what enters and exits and regulate environmental interactions _ We’ll explore transport of things in and out of the cell in more detail in the next module."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane_mod_summary2,"Review the following key terms and when you’re ready, take the module quiz."
phys_prop_cell,_u3_m2_cell_membrane_mod_summary3,The following key terms were introduced in this module.
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids1,"Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:"
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids2,"The cell is composed of two distinctive environments: the hydrophilic aqueous cytoplasm and the hydrophobic lipid membranes _ The lipid environment is defined by the family of molecules that are characterized by their hydrophobic nature and their common metabolic origin _ Three members of the lipid family of molecules will be discussed in this course: fats (triacylglcerol), phospholipids, and steroids _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids3,"Lipid molecules are slightly soluble to insoluble in water _ Lipids are hydrophobic because the molecules consist of long, 16-18 carbon, hydrocarbon chains (or backbones) with only a small amount of oxygen containing groups _ Lipids serve many functions in organisms _ Fats (or triglycerides) are used to store energy _ Phospholipids and steroids are the key components of cell membranes _ Lipds are also the major components of waxes, pigments, and steroid hormones."
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids4," Fats are synthesized from two different classes of molecules: fatty acids and alcohol _ The fatty acids are unbranched hydrocarbons that terminate with a single carboxyl functional group _ The fatty acids are generally 16-22 carbons long and can be both saturated and unsaturated _ Saturated fatty acids have no carbon-carbon double bonds (they are saturated with hydrogen), while the unsaturated fatty acids have one to three double bonds along the backbone carbon chain _ These double bonds introduce ""kinks"" in the carbon chain which have important consequences on the fluid nature of lipid membranes _ Unsaturated fatty acids have lower melting points than saturated fatty acids _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids5,"To construct a fat, or triacylglycerol, three fatty acid molecules are attached to the glycerol through an ester bond between the carboxyl group of the fatty acids and the three alcohol groups of a glycerol molecule _ This is another example of a condensation reaction that results in formation of an ester in this case and the release of a water molecule _ A fat molecule can be composed of one, two, or three different types of fatty acids each of which can be saturated or unsaturated _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids6,"An unsaturated fat has at least one unsaturated fatty acid, whereas a saturated fat has none _ Because the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acids introduce kinks in the hydrocarbon backbone, unsaturated fats will not pack into a regular structure and thus remain fluid at lower temperatures _ A saturated fat will pack well and be a solid a low temperatures _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids7,"Fats are mainly energy storage and insulating molecules _ Per gram, fats contain twice as much energy as carbohydrates _ Layers of fat also surround the vital organs of animals to cushion them, and layers of fat under the skin of animals provide insulation _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids8," Phospholipids contain only two fatty acids attached to a glycerol head _ This occurs by a condensation reaction similar to the one discussed above _ The third alcohol of the glycerol forms an ester bond through reaction with phosphoric acid _ This is another example of a condensation reaction between an acid and an alcohol with the release of water _ As a triprotic acid (i.e it has three acidic functions on the phorphorus atom) the phosphate group attached to the glycerol has the potential to form ester links with a variety of other molecules such as carbohydrates, choline, inositol and amino acids _ The phosphate group along with the glycerol group make the head of the phospholipid hydrophilic, whereas the fatty acid tail is hydrophobic _ Thus phospholipids are amphipathic:a molecule with a polar end and a hydrophobic end _ When phospholipids are in an aqueous solution they will self assemble into micelles or bilayers, structures that exclude water molecules from the hydrophobic tails while keeping the hydrophilic head in contact with the aqueous solution _ View the animation that demonstrates the formation of micelles and bilayers _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids9,"Phospholipids serve a major function in the cells of all organisms: they form the phospholipid membranes that surround the cell and intracellular organelles such as the mitochondria _ The cell membrane is a fluid, semi-permeable bilayer that separates the cell's contents from the environment, see animation below _ The membrane is fluid at physiological temperatures and allows cells to change shape due to physical constraints or changing cellular volumes _ The phospholipid membrane allows free diffusion of some small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small hydrocarbons, but not charged ions, polar molecules or other larger molecules such as glucose _ This semi-permeable nature of the membrane allows the cell to maintain the composition of the cytoplasm independent of the external environment _ "
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids10, The steroids are a family of lipids based on a molecule with four fused carbon rings _ This family includes many hormones and cholesterol _ Cholesterol is a component of the cell membrane in animals and functions to moderate membrane fluidity because it restricts the motion of the fatty acid tails _ 
phys_prop_cell,phospholipids11,Examine the effect of cholesterol on membrane fluidity using the animations below.
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure1,"Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:"
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure2,The cell membrane must be a dynamic structure if the cell is to grow and respond to environmental changes _ To keep the membrane fluid at physiological temperatures the cell alters the composition of the phospholipids _ The right ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids keeps the membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life _ For example winter wheat responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes _ In animal cells cholesterol helps to prevent the packing of fatty acid tails and thus lowers the requirement of unsaturated fatty acids _ This helps maintain the fluid nature of the cell membrane without it becoming too liquid at body temperature _ The fluidity of the membrane is demonstrated in the following animation _ The lipids in the membrane are in random bulk flow moving about 22 µm (micrometers) per second _ Phospholipids freely move in the same layer of the membrane and rarely flip to the other layer _ Flipping of phospholipids from one layer to the other rarely occurs because flipping requires the hydrophilic head to pass through the hydrophobic region of the bilayer _ 
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure3,"Because the cell membrane is only semipermeable, the cell needs a way to communicate with other cells and exchange nutrients with the extracellular space _ These roles are primarily filled by proteins _ Membrane proteins are classified into two major categories, integral proteins and peripheral proteins.  Integral membrane proteins are those proteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer and are generally characterized by their solubility in non-polar, hydrophobic solvents _ Transmembrane proteins are examples of integral proteins with hydrophobic regions that completely span the hydrophobic interior of the membrane _ The parts of the protein exposed to the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic _ Integral proteins can serve as pores that selectively allow ions or nutrients into the cell _ They also transmit signals into and out of the cell _ Unlike integral proteins that span the membrane, peripheral proteins reside on only one side of the membrane and are often attached to integral proteins _ Some peripheral proteins serve as anchor points for the cytoskeleton or extracellular fibers _ Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly _ Some move in seemingly directed manner while others drift."
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure4,"The extracellular surface of the cell membrane is decorated with carbohydrate groups attached to lipids and proteins _ Carbohydrates are added to lipids and proteins by a process called glycosylation, and are called glycolipids or glycoproteins _ These short carbohydrates, or oligosaccharides, are usually chains of 15 or fewer sugar molecules _ Oligosaccharides give a cell identity (i.e., distinguishing self from non-self) and are the distinguishing factor in human blood types and transplant rejection."
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure5," As discussed above and seen in the picture, the cell membrane is asymmetric _ The extracellular face of the membrane is in contact with the extracellular matrix _ The extracellular side of the membrane contains oligosaccharides that distinguish the cell as self _ It also contains the end of integral proteins that interact with signals from other cells and sense the extracellular environment _ The inner membrane is in contact the contents of the cell _ This side of the membrane anchors to the cytoskeleton and contains the end of integral proteins that relay signals received on the external side."
phys_prop_cell,membrane_structure6,"The biological membrane is a collage of many different proteins embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer _ The lipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane, and its structure creates a semi-permeable membrane _ The hydrophobic core impedes the diffusion of hydrophilic structures, such as ions and polar molecules but allows hydrophobic molecules, which can dissolve in the membrane, to cross it with ease _ Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions _ The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each have unique collections of proteins _ For example, to date more than 50 kinds of proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells."
phys_prop_cell,transport_intro1,Membrane Transport
phys_prop_cell,transport_intro2,"The cell membrane provides a semi-permeable barrier between the inside and the outside of the cell _ This barrier provides control for transport of nutrients, ions and signals between the highly variable outside environment and the relatively well-defined interior of the cell _ This unit of the course will explore the ways in which molecules can pass across the membrane (diffusion and active transport), can be transported into the cell without passing across the membrane (endocytosis), and can send signals for actions within the cell without actually passing across the membrane themselves (signal transduction)."
phys_prop_cell,passive_simple_diffusion1,"Both large and small molecules follow the same general principal of diffusion _ Molecules spontaneously move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration following Brownian motion _ The classic example is the diffusion of a drop of ink placed in a beaker of water _ The concentrated drop of color slowly disperses (diffuses) until at some point equilibrium is reached in which the beaker appears to have a uniform color _ The following animation depicts this simple diffusion process _ Add ink to each beaker and watch the diffusion process _ After a period of time, is there a difference in the distribution of ink in each beaker? Follow the yellow ink molecule in each beaker for some time _ In which simulation does the yellow ball take longer to transverse the beaker?"
phys_prop_cell,passive_simple_diffusion2,The introduction of a cell or liposome into the solution places a barrier to the molecules _ As three different molecules diffuse to equilibrium they encounter the lipid bilayer depicted by the horizontal membrane across the center of the stage in the following animation _ Note that one type of molecule passes freely through the lipid bilayer while the second type of molecule only occasionally passes through the membrane and the lipid bilayer is totally impermeable to the third type of molecule.
phys_prop_cell,passive_simple_diffusion3,"Of the first two types of molecules, the first type might include a molecule such as cholesterol which has some solubility in water but is highly soluble in the non-polar environment of the lipid bilayer and thus will freely pass into the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, distribute freely in the membrane and then some fraction will dissolve in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm _ A second example of this type of permeable molecule is water which while polar is small and able to freely pass across the membrane _ The lipid bilayer is much less permeable to the second type of molecule indicating a more polar character and a larger size _ Examples of such molecules are the sodium and chloride ions _ As a general rule, charged molecules are much less permeable to the lipid bilayer _ The third type of molecule is very polar, in many cases charged, and usually a larger molecule _ Examples are carbohydrates and amino acids _ "
phys_prop_cell,passive_simple_diffusion4, Aspirin In Protonated and non-Protonated States 
phys_prop_cell,osmosis1, Osmosis 
phys_prop_cell,osmosis2,"Cells continually encounter changes in their external ionic environment and will spontaneously respond by attempting to equalize the concentration of ions on the inside and outside of the cell _ Because the plasma membrane (lipid bilayer) is significantly less permeable to ions than water, the establishment of an equal concentration of the ions on either side of the membrane is accomplished by the net movement of water toward the higher concentration of ions to reduce the concentration _ This movement of water in response to an imbalance of solute (ion) is referred to as osmosis _ This is illustrated in the following simulation _ "
phys_prop_cell,osmosis3,"Three different conditions may exist in the relationship between the solute (ion) concentration and solvent (water) concentration across a membrane _ Isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic refer to the relative concentration of the solute (small molecules) in the extracellular (outside) space surrounding the cell relative to the solute concentration inside the cell _ In an isotonic solution, the concentration of the solute and therefore solvent water (water potential) is the same on both sides _ A hypotonic solution is one whose solute concentration is lower (water concentration is higher [i.e _ high water potential]) in the extracellular space than inside the cell _ Because the water (the solvent) can more easily pass through the membrane than can the solute (ions), the net flow is spontaneous in the direction of the solvent (water) moving from its higher concentration (high water potential) outside the cell to the inside of the cell _ Conversely, a hypertonic solution refers to an extracellular solution with a higher solute concentration (lower water concentration [i.e _ low water potential]) outside the cell than inside the cell _ In this case, the more permeable solvent, water, would flow spontaneously out of the cell toward the low water potential to dilute the solute molecules and create an equal concentration of solute molecules on both sides of the membrane."
phys_prop_cell,facilitated_diffusion1, Facilitated Diffusion 
phys_prop_cell,facilitated_diffusion2,"Cells must be able to move polar molecules such as nutrients and ions across the lipid bilayer of the membrane in order to carry out life processes _ But the molecules will still move spontaneously down a concentration from high to low concentration _ To allow the polar molecules, which are not soluble in the lipid bilayer, to pass across the hydrophobic barrier it is necessary to provide ports, channels or holes through the membrane _ These channels can either allow the molecules to move freely according to their concentration differences or they can be gated channels that control the movement of the polar molecules according to the needs of the cell _ In most cases these channels are very discriminatory and will only allow specific molecules to pass; another example of bioselectivity _ The channels facilitate the movement of molecules that otherwise would not be spontaneously permeable to the lipid bilayer _ The process of moving impermeable molecules across a membrane using channels or pores is referred to as facilitated diffusion _ Because the molecules are moving down a concentration gradient the process is driven by simple diffusion _ The following simulation depicts the facilitated diffusion of glucose across the membrane using the glucose permease transporter."
phys_prop_cell,active_transport1,"In some cases it is necessary to move molecules against a gradient _ The eukaryotc cell, a typical mammalian cell, has many compartments within the cell each surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane _ In most cases the environment within the compartment is different than that in the cytoplasm _ An example is the lysosome, a degradative organelle (membrane bound compartment within the cell) whose function is to digest macromolecules delivered either from the outside of the cell or from other compartments within the cell _ To carry out this function the lysosome maintains a much lower pH inside the lysosome relative to the cytoplasm _ At equilibrium, the concentration of protons would be equal on both the inside and outside of the lysosome."
phys_prop_cell,active_transport2,"To decrease the pH inside of the lysosome, the concentration of protons will need to be greater inside the lysosome than in the cytoplasm _ To accomplish this protons will need to move from a low concentration to a high concentration _ This is a non-spontaneous process and requires the cell to do work to move the ions up-hill against the gradient _ To do work, the cell must expend energy and actively move (pump) the ions _ This process is referred to as active transport _ The source of energy for this process in most biological systems is the hydrolysis of ATP."
phys_prop_cell,active_transport3,"The following animation depicts another example of active transport; the sodium-potassium ATPase _ This active transport system moves three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, each against a gradient."
phys_prop_cell,active_transport4, Transport Proteins 
phys_prop_cell,active_transport5,"Facilitated diffusion and active transport both require channels or ports in the membrane through which the generally non-permeable molecules can pass _ These protein transporters contribute to the mosaic character of the fluid mosaic character of the biological membrane _ There are a variety of different structures associated with transport proteins and at the same time many transport proteins that carry out similar functions (e.g _ ion channels) have structural similarities while maintaining their ability to discriminate between molecules _ Thus transport proteins have been classified both by structure and by function _ For the purposes of this course, the classification will be that of function though similarities in structure will be observed in the examples chosen _ "
phys_prop_cell,active_transport6,"There are three classifications of transport proteins based on mechanism of transport: Uniport, Symport and Antiport _ The animations on the following pages will demonstrate the three classes of proteins with examples of each _ "

phys_prop_cell,uniports1, Uniport 
phys_prop_cell,uniports2,A uniport is a protein that transports a single molecule across the membrane of the cell _ 
phys_prop_cell,uniports3, Intracellular Transport 
phys_prop_cell,uniports4,The animation below shows how the glucose transporter molecule is structured with a spiral channel that allows the glucose molecules to passively navigate the channel and move through the membrane.
phys_prop_cell,uniports5, Intercellular Transport 
phys_prop_cell,uniports6,"The simulation below demonstrates how transmembrane protein structures from adjacent cells line up to form Gap Junctions, channels between cells that act as size exclusion transporters _ While water molecules are small enough to move through the membranes, the Gap Junctions facilitate that movement and the movement of molecules up to 1500 daltons (approximately a 15 amino acid peptide) but not larger molecules."
phys_prop_cell,symports1, Symport 
phys_prop_cell,symports2,A symport transports two different molecules across the membrane in the same direction in a cooperative manner.
phys_prop_cell,antiport1, Antiport 
phys_prop_cell,antiport2,Antiports transport two different molecules through the membrane in opposite directions.
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis1,"After studying this introduction to endocytosis, students will be able to:"
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis2, Endocytosis 
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis3,"While facilitated diffusion and active transport account for a great deal of the specific uptake of molecules and ions needed by the cell, other sources of external matter can also be taken up by the cell _ The channels and pores provide a means by which molecules can pass directly through the membrane to the cytoplasm _ Other mechanisms also exist by which molecules are taken up by the cell but do not directly pass through the plasma membrane _ This mechanism is referred to as endocytosis _ This mechanism involves the engulfing of the matter by the plasma membrane and internalization of the engulfed material inside a cytoplasmic vesicle _ Non-specific uptake of molecules occurs by phagocytosis (large particles and macromolecules) and pinocytosis (water soluble small molecules)."
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis4,"In general endocytosis, a molecule or particle encounters the cell surface and randomly causes the membrane to create first a pit in the membrane, followed by a further invagination of the plasma membrane and finally the pinching off of the plasma membrane around the molecule or particle resulting in the formation of a vesicle in the cytoplasm of the cell _ Note that during the process the asymmetry of the membrane would be apparent by the fact that the inside surface of the newly formed vesicle is the same as the exterior surface of the cell _ Thus the integrity of the cytoplasm and its exposure to only the inside surface of the membrane is preserved _ Exocytosis is just the reverse of this process with the fusion of an internal vesicle with the plasma membrane thus releasing its content to the outside _ The balance of exocytosis and endocytosis preserves the size of the plasma membrane and ensure neither growth nor shrinking of the cell size."
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis5,Once internalized the new vesicle fuses with a slightly acidic early endosome and subsequently with the lysosome where the contents of the original endocytic vesicle are digested and the digested products released to the cytoplasm where they are available for use by the cell _ This process is depicted in the following animation _ 
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis6, Protein Transduction – an example of macropinocytosis 
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis7,"In the early 1990’s an intriguing observation was made that has lead to a number of new approaches to drug delivery and therapeutic delivery systems _ It is based on an observation of the activity of the transactivator TAT protein associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and subsequently polyarginine (arginine is a positively charge, naturally occurring amino acid) and other proteins containing a basic peptide region referred to as the protein transduction domain (PTD) _ The observation was the translocation of virtually any molecule, particle, even liposome that has the PTD attached _ While there is still some debate as to the exact mechanism of the translocation, there is some agreement on the general process _ The highly positively charged PTD, attached to its ‘cargo’, has a tight electrostatic (ionic) interaction with certain molecules, which are ubiquitous to all cells, in the plasma membrane _ Binding to the surface initiates macropinocytosis (pinocytosis with a slightly larger soluble molecule) _ The presence of the PTD provides for high efficiency initiation of endocytosis _ While not involving a specific receptor, the binding by the PTD to the cell surface reduces the concentration dependence for initiation of internalization _ "
phys_prop_cell,endo_exocytosis8,In contrast to the normal endocytic vesicle the PTD directed endocytic vesicle undergoes retrograde transport _ In this process the new vesicle fusses with the Golgi and is the PTD containing proteins are transported back to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum where they undergo post-translational modification and are transduced directly to the cytoplasm _ 
phys_prop_cell,receptor_mediated1,"Upon further exploratiion of endocytosis, students will be able to: "

phys_prop_cell,receptor_mediated3,"Much as the channels and pores discriminate between specific molecules and their transport through the membrane, specificity and discrimination are seen during endocytosis using specific membrane bound receptors _ This targeting defines the uptake of specific molecules or assemblies by specific cells _ The following animation demonstrates the process of receptor mediated endocytosis for the Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) complex _ The process is divided into the individual steps to emphasize similarities and differences among general endocytosis, protein transduction and receptor mediated endocytosis _ Several general concepts are illustrated during the process including bioselectivity and intermediate recycling _ "
phys_prop_cell,signal_transduction1,"The plasma membrane is a very selective barrier _ We have seen how some small molecule pass freely, but most molecules are selectively brought into the cells using transporter proteins _ Most of these small molecules are metabolites or ions used in the general metabolism of the cell _ The cell also needs to transduce information across its membrane _ Cells receive signals from the surrounding fluids and other cells _ These signals may tell the cell to divide or prevent division and promote growth."
phys_prop_cell,signal_transduction2,The animation below demonstrates the action of signal transduction through a G-Protein coupled receptor _ The ligand is the external signal and it binds the receptor _ The G-Protein complex is now able to bind to the receptor _ This activates the G-protein by allowing the exchange of GTP for GDP _ When bound to GTP the G-protein is able to bind to Adenylate cyclase and activate it _ Adenylate cyclase generates the internal signal that is then interpreted by the cell.
phys_prop_cell,signal_transduction3, The following quiz will be graded and recorded in the grade book _ You may take this quiz only once.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_division_intro_01,"In this unit, you will learn about another major cell process — cell division, or cell reproduction _ The word ""reproduction"" is used in many different scientific and nonscientific settings _ Regardless of the setting, though, reproduction has the same basic meaning _ Reproduction is defined as ""the act of making a copy of the original."" With this in mind, the word reproduction can be applied to many different situations _ Some of these include parents having a baby, you photocopying a page in your textbook, and a museum staff member making print copies of a famous oil painting."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_division_intro_02,"In each case, a relatively close copy of the original has been made _ The same principle applies in cell reproduction—making new cells that closely resemble the original cell _ Cell reproduction is a complex process that involves many intricate, highly regulated steps _ Like metabolism, each of these steps must occur in a particular order."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_division_intro_03,Cell reproduction is important for three reasons:
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_division_intro_04," It provides new cells for growth, the replacement of dead cells, and healing _ In cells, it ensures the inheritance of genetic information from parent cell to offspring cell _ In organisms, it ensures the inheritance of genetic information from one generation to the next _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_division_intro_05,"In this unit, you will learn about how cells carry out these critical processes _ Your understanding of the information this unit will lay the foundation for understanding heredity and molecular genetics."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1a1,"Why do cells divide? Cells undergo different phases, during which they grow, duplicate their genetic material, and then divide _ In single-celled organisms, cell division results in two new individuals _ Cell division in multicellular organisms is more complex _ Most cells in multicellular organisms are somatic cells _ Somatic cells consist of all the nonreproductive cells in an organism; for example, tissue cells, nerve cells, and blood cells _ When somatic cells divide, they go through the process of mitosis, which is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1a2,"Meiosis, on the other hand, is a type of cell division that prepares an organism for sexual reproduction _ Meiosis begins with germ cells _ Be careful not to confuse “germ cells” with the common use of the word “germ,” which refers to any infectious microorganism _ In humans, germ cells are found in the ovaries and testes _ These germ cells go through the process of meiosis to produce gametes, which in animals are sperm and egg cells _ When two gametes from different individuals combine, a unique new cell is produced, called a zygote _ This single cell then goes through the process of mitosis to grow into a new individual."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1a3,"You might be wondering how a single cell can grow into a complex adult organism containing many different cell types simply by mitosis _ This happens through a process known as differentiation, in which certain genes found in a cell’s nucleus are turned on or off _ Even though every single somatic cell in your body contains identical DNA, these cells were able to differentiate into specific cell types (such as blood cell, liver cells, etc.) simply by turning certain genes on or off _ Throughout our lives, we continue to produce more genetically identical cells through the process of mitosis _ These somatic cells are essential for growth and replacement of worn-out cells and tissues."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1a4,Mitosis and meiosis are the processes by which cells divide and grow; their role in human growth is summarized in the diagram above _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b1,"Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside cells _ In eukaryotic cells, the chromosomes are contained inside an organelle called a nucleus _ In prokaryotic cells, they are located in a particular area of the cytoplasm _ Chromosomes are made up of two major parts: DNA and proteins _ Both DNA and proteins are large molecules _ Envision the general makeup of a chromosome, as shown in the following diagram."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b2,"DNA is the molecule that stores and transmits inherited genetic information _ This information includes the directions that tell a cell how to make proteins _ Information is stored in DNA in segments called genes _ In the diagram above, the ruler represents the entire DNA molecule _ The genes are represented as short segments of the ruler _ You will learn more about the structure and function of genes in the Molecular Genetics unit."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b3,"The blobs of clay in the diagram above represent histone protein molecules _ These proteins associate with DNA in a very precise way _ First, they couple with DNA at regularly spaced intervals _ Notice in the diagram above that the blobs of clay (histones) are located at equally spaced intervals along the ruler _ Second, they help to wind the DNA molecule into an organized and compact structure _ The following diagram shows how histones wind DNA into a compact structure called a chromosome."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b4,"The winding function of histones plays a very important role in cells _ It allows the DNA to be condensed into organized bundles (chromosomes) that can easily be moved around the cell _ Because the DNA is wound around the histones in such an organized way, the DNA can be easily wound up and unwound at various points during the cell cycle _ For example, chromosomes must unwind slightly when a new copy of DNA is made _ In order for a new copy of the DNA to be made, the replication enzymes must be able to access the DNA _ It is nearly impossible for these enzymes to get to the DNA if the DNA is tightly bound by histone proteins _ Therefore, the chromosomes are unwound prior to DNA replication _ Following DNA replication (synthesis), the chromosomes become very tightly wound as the cell gets ready to divide during mitosis or meiosis _ Without an organized compaction system, the long pieces of DNA in chromosomes could easily become ""knotted"" and tangled _ Think of a long piece of string _ Knots can easily form in the string if it is not carefully wound up into a ball _ Keeping the DNA organized is critical, especially when you consider that the DNA in one human cell is three feet long when it is stretched out straight _ This is quite amazing when you realize that this must fit into a cell so small that it cannot be seen with the naked eye _ This feat is achieved by two different winding processes _ One of these is the winding of DNA around histone molecules _ As a result of this winding, the DNA molecule becomes shorter than before it was wound around the histone molecules _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b5,"The videos below are two illustrations of the winding of DNA around histones _ The left video shows the DNA strand coiling and condensing to form chromosomes; on the right, a model depicts the structure of DNA."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1b6,"Now look at an image of the relationship between DNA and histones in chromosomes that is more realistic than what is shown in our ruler-and-clay diagram above _ When the DNA becomes tightly wound around the histone proteins, imagine that the chromosome looks as illustrated below."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c1," The chromosomes in somatic cells and germ cells are present in pairs _ One chromosome in each pair is descended from the organism's father _ The other chromosome in the pair is descended from the organism's mother _ Each member of a chromosome pair is called a homologue _ Together, these two chromosomes make up a pair of homologous chromosomes _ The words homologue and homologous both begin with the prefix ""homo-,"" which means ""the same or similar."" So the two chromosomes in each pair contain the same set of instructions _ The following diagram shows the relationship between homologues and homologous chromosomes _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c2,"Somatic cells produced through mitosis are diploid _ “Di-” means “two,” and diploid cells contain two copies of every chromosome _ Chromosomes are the condensed form of chromatin, the combination of DNA and proteins that fill the eukaryotic nucleus _ Humans have a total of 46 chromosomes in their diploid cells _ One way to write this is ""2n = 46."" Humans who have more or less than 46 chromosomes sometimes survive, but usually have life-altering conditions, such as Down syndrome _ Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c3,Examine the following image of the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in a single somatic cell of a normal human _ Notice that there are 22 pairs of chromosomes called autosomes and there is one pair of chromosomes called sex chromosomes _ Males and females have different sex chromosomes _ An image like this is called a karyotype and can be used to diagnose genetic disorders in humans _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c4,"Gametes are haploid cells _ They contain only one copy of each chromosome _ In human haploid gametes, there are 23 chromosomes _ One way to write this is ""1n = 23."" As you learned in the previous activity, two haploid cells can combine, through the process of fertilization, to form a diploid zygote _ The diploid zygote then goes through mitosis to form the diploid somatic cells of the organism _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c5,"Remember that germ cells, found in the ovaries and testes, give rise to gametes _ In other words, germ cells go through meiosis to produce gametes _ Germ cells are diploid cells _ When they go through meiosis, the end result is four unique haploid daughter cells _ These haploid cells can be fertilized by other haploid cells to produce diploid cells again _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c6,"A cell that is 2N = 6 has 6 total chromosomes _ This cell is diploid (2N) because it has two sets of chromosomes _ Each parent would have given this cell three chromosomes — one parent donating the chromosomes seen in the top row, the other donating the chromosomes seen in the bottom row _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication_intro_1c7,"The table below summarizes the characteristics of somatic cells, germ cells, and gametes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview1,"Every living organism goes through various stages of development _ For example, human beings go through these stages of development: fetus, infant, child, youth, teenager, young adult, adult _ Remember from earlier that cells are living things _ They, too, go through a set of programmed stages."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview2,"The cell cycle is the ""life cycle"" of a cell _ It is the set of stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime _ Cells go through five major stages of development: G1, synthesis (S), G2, mitosis (M), and cytokinesis _ The events that occur during stages G1, S, and G2 are nearly the same in all types of cells _ Together, these three stages of the cell cycle are called interphase _ The events that occur during mitosis (M) and cytokinesis stages are different, depending upon the type of cell _ The diagram below shows an overview of the stages in a cell's life cycle:"
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview3,"Notice in the diagram above that we start with one cell on the left side _ This is called the parent cell _ It is called this because, like a human parent, it reproduces—it makes new cells that are copies of itself _ The parent cell goes through the five stages of development in this order — G1, S, G2, M, and cytokinesis."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview4,"At the end of the development process, two new cells are produced _ These cells represent the next generation of cells in this lineage (just as your parents represent one generation and you represent the next generation) _ Each of the new cells is called a daughter cell _ Do not be confused by the use of the word daughter—it does not mean that these are female cells _ Regardless of whether they are male or female cells, the newly produced cells are called daughter cells."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview5,"Notice that the parent cell no longer exists—but the parent cell did not die _ Rather, the contents of the parent cell have been split into two new cells _ Each of the new cells contains a portion of the original parent cell _ Previously, we compared the cell cycle to the phases of human development _ Notice here a very important difference between the two: The far end of human development is marked by the death of the individual _ The end of the cell cycle, however, results in the formation of new cells."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_cycle_overview6,"In the diagram ""Overview of the Cell Cycle"" above, look closely at the parent cell and the two daughter cells _ Notice that they look the same _ Once again, we revisit the theme of cycles in nature that we discussed above _ The cycle generates cells that resemble the cells we started with _ In addition, the new cells undergo the same development-and-division process that their parental cell did _ For these two reasons, we call this the cell cycle, and draw it like a circle _ Similarly, human beings have children, who then have children themselves _ (You may have heard this called the circle of life.) Cells do the same thing through the cell cycle _ The following diagram shows the cell cycle in circular form."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_21,"In cell replication, chromosomes are moved to new locations _ Like packing household materials into a box before moving, condensing the chromosomes helps with this process _ Chromosomes are condensed by wrapping them more tightly around histones (proteins found in the nucleus)."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_22,"If a cell is going to reproduce, more DNA is needed _ During mitosis, one cell divides into two cells containing identical genetic material _ This requires twice as much DNA, because there must be one complete set for each daughter cell _ Meiosis also requires the DNA to be replicated _ DNA replication (or DNA synthesis) occurs in the synthesis (S) stage of the cell cycle _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_23,"After a chromosome has replicated, the two copies remain attached at a point called the centromere _ Each copy of the chromosome is called a chromatid."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_24,"During cell division, each chromatid moves to one of the two daughter cells _ Keeping the two copies of a single chromosome attached helps the sorting process _ In human cells, there are a total of 46 chromosomes _ After the S stage of the cell cycle, these chromosomes have replicated _ The process of mitosis must sort these into 2 identical piles of 46 chromosomes _ The cell keeps the matching pairs attached to keep track of which chromosomes need to be sent to opposite poles."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_25,"This is rather like sorting a sock drawer _ If all the socks are loose in the drawer, it can be challenging to find the identical mate to a sock _ But if the sock mates are folded together, each bundle contains both mates in the set."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_cell_replication-Intro_26,"Both mitosis and meiosis must keep track of the chromatids on a chromosome _ In the Meiosis module, you will learn that meiosis must also keep track of homologous chromosomes _ A diploid cell has two copies of each chromosome — one copy from each parent _ These chromosome pairs are called homologous because they have the same genes, but may have different versions of that gene _ For example, a homologous pair of chromosomes may have a gene for hair color _ One chromosome in this homologue may contain a “blond” version of that gene and the other homologue may contain the “brown” version _ Each gamete that is produced will get either the homologue with the brown version or the homologue with the blond version."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary1,Multicelled organisms are made of two main types of cells.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary2, Somatic cells are all the nonreproductive cells _ Somatic cells are diploid and reproduce using mitosis _ Diploid cells (2N) have two copies of each chromosome _ Germ cells are immature reproductive cells _ Germ cells are diploid and divide using meiosis to produce gametes _ Gametes are haploid reproductive cells (sperm and eggs) _ Haploid cells (1N) have one copy of each chromosome _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary3,"Cell division (mitosis and meiosis) sorts the genetic material (DNA) of a cell _ This sorting of genetic material is essential, because most of the essential information for life is stored in the DNA _ Each newly formed daughter cell must receive identical information; therefore the DNA in a cell must be copied before cell division begins _ The copied DNA strands remain attached near their centers in a region called the centromere _ Each copy of the DNA is called a chromatid, and both copies are called a chromosome _ The cell packages the DNA so that it can be sorted between the new cells _ The DNA is packaged by wrapping it tightly around proteins called histones _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary4,"In diploid cells (cells with two copies of each chromosome) each chromosome has a homologue _ Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, but they can have different versions of those genes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary5,"In the next module, you will examine the details of mitosis _ But before you move on, review these key terms and prepare for the module quiz."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_cell_and_chrom_mod_summary6,"Review the following key terms introduced in this module _ When you are ready, check your understanding of cells and chromosomes by taking the quiz linked below."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_11,"Growing from a single fertilized egg to an adult organism requires many rounds of cell division _ Before cell division, a cell must copy its genome so that each new daughter cell receives a full set of DNA _ This DNA replication occurs in the synthesis (S) stage of the cell cycle just prior to mitosis _ The process of mitosis sorts the DNA equally into two separate nuclei _ The process of mitosis is divided into the following steps or phases: "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_12, Prophase and Prometaphase: The cell prepares to sort the chromosomes _ Metaphase: Chromosomes are moved to the center of the cell _ Anaphase: Chromosomes are sorted _ Telophase: The new nuclei are formed _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_13,"Each new cell gets one of these nuclei during the process of cytokinesis _ At the end of mitosis and cytokinesis, each new daughter cell should have the identical genetic makeup of the parent cell _ Mitosis of a single diploid cell will result in two diploid cells with identical genomes, unless a mutation or other error occurred _ Mitosis of a haploid cell will result in two identical haploid cells _ These cells can go through the process again to reproduce."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_14,"Let’s begin with a diploid cell that is 2N = 4 _ This cell has two copies of each of its two chromosomes _ During the S phase of interphase, the cell replicates its DNA _ This results in two sister chromatids that are attached to each other at the centromere _ The chromosomes have not condensed enough at this point to be visible with a microscope."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_15,Centrosomes are also formed during interphase _ Centrosomes are used to identify the poles of the cell during the division process; these poles determine where the chromosomes will be sent.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_16,Perform the following activity to build a cell ready for mitosis _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev1,"Mitosis begins when DNA condenses into chromosomes visible under a light microscope _ This packaging of the chromosomes into condensed bundles makes them easier to sort, but it inhibits protein synthesis _ Therefore, it is essential that the cell has produced all necessary proteins prior to the start of this process."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev2,The nucleoli disappear and the nuclear envelope begins to disintegrate _ This allows cellular components to act upon the chromosomes (the chromosomes are no longer tucked away inside the nucleus).
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev3,"Centrioles, contained in the centrosomes formed during interphase, are areas where microtubules originate in order to help sort and organize the sister chromatids _ The centrioles begin to move to the opposite poles of the cell _ This will determine where the chromosomes go when they are sorted."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev4,Microtubules are disassembled from the cytoplasm and reassembled into the mitotic spindle _ This structure will move the chromosomes to the proper location.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev5,"This stage is called “prophase,” because it is a preparatory stage _ “Pro-” means ""before;"" “phase” means “stage.” So, this is the stage before the process gets into full swing."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev6,"Prometaphase is the stage between prophase and metaphase _ During this stage, the nuclear envelope is fully broken down _ This allows the microtubules to attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev7,"The centromere is the region in the center of the X-shaped chromosomes _ Each half of the X is a copy of the same DNA strand _ The centromere contains proteins that hold together these two copies and can bind to the microtubules _ The proteins on the centromere are called the kinetochore, and the microtubules that attach to them are called kinetochore microtubules _ The microtubules that are not attached to the kinetochores are called nonkinetochore microtubules."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev8,Metaphase is so named because the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell _ The root “meta-” means “middle.”
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev9,The kinetochore microtubules are used to orient the chromosomes in the center of the cell _ Each chromosome will be attached to two kinetochore microtubules _ Each of these kinetochore microtubules will be attached to one of the two centrioles.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev10,"During anaphase, the kinetochore proteins break down the microtubules attached to them and the connections between each copy of the chromosome will be broken down _ This causes the individual chromosomes to move to opposite poles of the cell _ The root “ana-” refers to “apart”; the chromosomes are moving apart from each other."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev11,"The nonkinetochore microtubules from one pole also push on the nonkinetochore microtubules from the other pole _ This causes the cell to elongate _ By the end of anaphase, each pole of the cell contains an identical set of chromosomes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev12,"In telophase, the nuclei at each pole form again _ The chromosomes are now separated into two identical nuclei _ This is the end of mitosis _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev13,"However, the two nuclei are still in a single cell _ The next step will separate the cytoplasm into two cells _ “Telo” comes from the Greek word for “end.”"
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev14,Cytokinesis is the separation of the cytoplasm into two new daughter cells _ Animal cells divide when proteins pinch in the center of the cell until it separates into two _ This region is called the cleavage furrow _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_3-rev15,Plant cells divide when new cell wall components are laid down in the center of the cell _ This is called the cell plate.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_91,"Use the activities on this page to review the process of mitosis _ Do the activities as many times as you’d like, until you feel comfortable with the whole process."

cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_93,Perform the following activity to depict each phase of mitosis _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_41,The cell cycle is highly regulated _ There are many checkpoints that are used to determine if the cell should or should not continue through the stages of the cell cycle _ Many different environmental and internal signals are involved in determining whether or not a cell will complete division.
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_42,"A healthy cell has many genes that produce proteins involved in the process of regulating cell division _ Some of these genes produce proteins that encourage cell division _ These proteins would be produced under circumstances where the cell should divide _ For example, if you scrape your knee, the cells in that area need to be replaced _ Other genes produce proteins that inhibit cell division _ For example, healthy human cells grown on a petri dish would stop growing when they filled the dish _ This is also an essential component of regulation _ Cells that continue dividing when they should not can cause cancer."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_43,"Numerous research projects in the past and present are investigating cell cycle genes _ Some of these research projects are focused on cancer treatments and cures and others are focused on understanding the biology of this process _ Because much of this research is focused on cancer, the terminology used is generally focused on relationship to the disease _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_44,"For example, genes that inhibit cell division are classified as tumor suppressor genes _ If these genes are working properly, a cell will not divide uncontrollably because these genes will stop the process _ Genes that encourage cell division are called proto-oncogenes _ If these genes are working properly, a cell will not receive the message to divide unless it should be dividing _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_45,"Mutations could cause proto-oncogenes to stop working properly _ Mutations are errors in DNA that can result from genetic predisposition or environmental factors _ Mutagens are chemicals in the environment that produce mutations _ Carcinogens are specifically those mutagens that have shown that they can cause cancer _ Cigarettes, for example, contain carcinogens that can alter the DNA and disrupt proper regulation of the cell cycle."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic-Mitosis_46,"The development of cancer requires mutations in BOTH proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes _ A malfunctioning proto-oncogene is called an oncogene because it promotes the development of cancer _ The root “proto-” refers to ""before"" and the root “onco-” refers to ""cancer."" A defective tumor suppressor gene can no longer suppress tumors _ Cancer is the result of numerous mutations in multiple genes involved in regulating the cell cycle."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_Mitosis_quiz_wrapper1,"Mitosis is the process by which eukaryotic cells divide into two identical daughter cells _ The process ensures identical DNA is present in both daughter cells _ Organisms use mitosis to grow and replace old or malfunctioning cells _ There are checkpoints during the cell cycle that regulate whether or not a cell goes through mitosis _ When this regulation goes awry, cells can begin to divide uncontrollably, possibly resulting in cancerous tumors _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_Mitosis_quiz_wrapper2,"Mitosis results in identical daughter cells _ However, sexually-reproducing organisms need a way to produce gametes, which are unique haploid cells that combine to form new organisms _ In the next module, you'll learn more about meiosis, which is the process used to produce gametes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_Mitosis_quiz_wrapper3,"Before you move into the next module, review these key terms and take the module quiz."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u6_Mitosis_quiz_wrapper4,Review the following key terms that were introduced in this module _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_1a1,"There are two ways for organisms to reproduce: asexual and sexual _ Many organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and even some plants and animals reproduce asexually _ During asexual reproduction, all of the genes in a cell are passed to its daughter cells _ This means that the resulting cells are clones, or identical copies of the parental cell."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_1a2,"Asexual reproduction is efficient and fast _ However, it only provides one set of genes to adapt to the environment _ Think about trying to guess a number _ Do you have a better chance of guessing the number if you get one guess or if you get two guesses? Sexual reproduction, in which the genes of two parents are combined, results in more genetic variability _ This enables offspring to deal more successfully with environmental change _ However, sexual reproduction is a more complex process and results in a smaller number of offspring _ Interestingly, certain organisms that can reproduce both asexually and sexually will choose sexual reproduction only when environmental conditions are not optimal _ That way, a smaller number of more variable, and thus more adaptable, offspring is produced _ In optimal conditions, however, asexual reproduction is the favored mechanism _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_1a3,"As you learned, genetic information is contained in DNA, which in eukaryotic cells is bound to special proteins called histones _ The combination of DNA and histone proteins is called chromatin _ During the S phase of the cell cycle, the chromatin is loose, to facilitate DNA replication _ Chromatin can condense to form chromosomes during nuclear division _ Chromosomes have a typical appearance and can be organized in a karyotype."

cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_intro_v11,"Why do children look like their parents? How do rose growers get so many different colors of roses — pink, red, white, yellow, purple, peach, striped, and many more? How can there be different-colored puppies within one litter? "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_intro_v12,"In the Cell Division unit, you learned that cells pass on a complete set of genetic information (contained in the DNA), which is transmitted from parent cells to daughter cells _ This genetic information helps determine many of the characteristics of the offspring _ In humans, for instance, DNA is responsible for a child’s height and skin pigmentation _ It also helps determine the overall health of the child by regulating many physiological characteristics, such as the condition of the heart and lungs, as well as brain and blood chemistry."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_intro_v13,"How much of our physiological makeup is determined by genetics, and how much is determined by other factors, such as personal choice and environment? This question is a source of ongoing debate in both scientific and philosophical communities _ Environmental factors can influence our DNA, and our DNA can influence how we react to environmental factors _ If we are ever able to answer this question, the answer will likely be complex."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_intro_v14,"In this unit, you will focus on the direct links between genetic information and visible traits _ This will help you to learn how genetic information can be passed from one generation to the next and how these genes affect the later generation _ We will introduce simple examples of traits that are clearly visible and have a direct correlation to genetics _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_p21,"In The Cell unit component structures of the cell were discussed _ One of these components is the DNA, which is arranged into one or more chromosomes _ Each chromosome contains many genes _ A gene is a region of a chromosome that has a specific function _ For example, genes can contain information required to make a protein _ How this happens will be discussed in the Molecular Genetics Unit."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_p22,"DNA carries the information about how proteins are built, and proteins carry out many of the reactions necessary for living organisms _ The Proteins module discussed the variety of roles proteins can play in a living organism _ Some proteins produced by living organisms determine the traits we can observe _ These visible traits are called the phenotype of an organism."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_p23,"For example, protein enzymes in plants catalyze production of the pigments, resulting in flowers of different colors _ The color of the flower is one of the observable traits, or the phenotype of the plant _ The genetic information that produces these traits is called the genotype of an organism _ Depending on the pigment production, the flowers can have a variety of different colors _ Flower color is determined by specific genes in the cells _ The variations in the same gene are called alleles _ In our example, different alleles of the pigment-producing gene can result in more or less pigment, and, consequently, in darker or light flower color _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_p24,"In this unit, you will learn about the genotype and phenotype of diploid organisms _ Diploid cells have two copies of each chromosome; haploid cells have only one copy of each chromosome _ Because diploid cells have two copies of each chromosome, they also have two copies of every gene _ One set of chromosomes (and, therefore, one copy of each gene) is from the mother (or egg) and one set is from the father (or sperm) _ Diploid cells can have two of the same alleles of a gene, or they can have two different alleles of a gene _ Cells that have the same allele are called homozygous (“homo” meaning ""same,"" and “zygous” referring to the reproductive cells produced from meiosis) _ These cells are called homozygous because all of their reproductive cells (gametes) will have identical alleles _ Cells with different alleles are called heterozygous (“hetero” meaning ""different"") because they will produce reproductive cells that have different alleles of this gene."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1a1,"In spite of the fact that all cells share certain characteristics, there is incredible diversity in structure and function among different cells _ The human body alone contains trillions of cells of more than 200 different types, each with a unique structure and function _ Cells are categorized into two types: Prokaryotes are small, simple, single-cell organisms; bacteria are the most prevalent kind _ Eukaryotes are larger, and most often they are multicellular organisms, including plants, animals, and fungi _ Eukaryotic cells are about 15 times wider than the typical prokaryotic cell, and up to 1,000 times greater in volume _ The images below show examples of a prokaryote and single-celled eukaryotic organisms _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1a2,"You have already learned that cells are made up of organelles, molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles _ These parts assemble into various structures to perform specific functions within the cell _ An organelle is a specialized structure formed when a specific set of molecules bond, providing a subunit that performs a particular function within the cell _ Many, but not all, organelles are structures enclosed by a membrane _ Some structures are the same for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types and some structures are different _ The remainder of this page will focus on a handful of structures that all cells have in common _ Then, later in this module, you will learn about the structures and characteristics of each cell type in more detail _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m1_cell_structure_1a3,"There are several parts (referred to as structures) common to all cells regardless of the cell type _ All cells are surrounded by a cell membrane _ The cell membrane provides a barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell and it regulates the flow of substances in and out of the cell _ All cells also have cytoplasm, which is the fluid that occupies the space inside the cell _ Cytoplasm is the space in which the chemical reactions that enable life take place _ All cells also contain DNA, which is often called the “master molecule” of the cell because it contains the instructions for synthesizing all of the cell’s proteins _ As you already know, proteins are the raw materials used to build many important structures in living systems _ Finally, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain ribosomes _ Ribosomes are the molecular machines that use the instructions contained in the DNA to build all the proteins needed by the cell."

cell_repro_and_genetics,proteins_intro1,"Proteins are the most functionally diverse group of biomolecules we will examine in this unit _ Critical to our diet, protein can be found in animal products like meats and cheeses, as well as in plant products like beans and grains _ Kwashiorkor, which causes a distinct swelling of the abdomen, is often seen in malnourished children who lack sufficient protein in their diets _ Proteins are also found in many toxins, such as the incredibly poisonous toxin produced by the bacterial species Clostridium botulinum _ Studies have shown that just one teaspoon of this poison, which is a protein, would be enough to kill 20 percent of the world’s population! This module will take a closer look at the structure of a protein and examine how protein structure enables such a wide range of diverse functions _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_gametes1,"When you studied meiosis, you learned about how gametes were formed _ But how are alleles dispersed into gametes through the process of meiosis? This activity will help you answer that question as you review the essential components of meiosis needed to understand inheritance _ You may wish to review the Meiosis module prior to continuing with this unit."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_gametes2,"This cell contains a pair of homologous chromosomes _ Homologous chromosomes are two chromosomes with the same genes, but which often have different alleles _ In our example, we have highlighted a gene _ Notice that one of the chromosomes has the ""A"" version (or allele) of this gene and the other has the ""a"" allele of this gene."

cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_gametes6,Drag four cells that depict the cell after Meiosis II into the boxes below.
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel1,"Gregor Mendel was a nineteenth-century Augustinian monk in Bohemia, a country in Europe that is now part of the Czech Republic."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel2,"In 1853, Mendel left the monastery for two years to study at the University of Vienna, where he learned about mathematics and botany _ When he returned to the monastery, he began investigating how plants passed on their characteristics to their offspring _ He was conducting this research only a few years before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel3,"Mendel set out to understand inheritance by breeding pea plants _ By collecting peas from pods produced after fertilizing two parent pea plants, Mendel could then grow those peas into new pea plants and see how these offspring resemble or differ from the parent plants _ The heritable characteristics that Mendel studied included seed color and shape, pod color and shape, flower color and position, and stem length _ Each of the traits that Mendel studied occurs only in two forms, or phenotypes _ For instance, pea flower color is a trait that can exhibit either the purple phenotype or the white phenotype."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel4,"Mendel used so-called true-breeding plants, which means that they always looked like their progenitors (selected over several years) _ He chose two varieties: one that always had purple flowers, and one that always had white flowers."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel5,"So if we know the phenotype, and we know that those two varieties would always result in same-color flowers, we can deduce that all individuals (plants) in that population (purple or white) have the same alleles for the gene that determines flower color _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel6,"Next, Mendel crossed the purple variety with the white variety _ He manipulated his plants so he could control which plant pollinated which _ In plants, pollen is the male gamete, landing on the flower to fuse with the ovule—the female gamete _ The resulting zygote will give rise to the seed, or embryo."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel7,"When Mendel crossed purple and white flowers, the first generation of plants, which he designated “F1,” were all purple _ Somehow, purple was “stronger,” or dominant over the white _ So if the alleles of the purple flowers were symbolized by “B,"" then the allele corresponding to white flowers was “weaker” and is symbolized by “b.” If the genotype of the parent purple flower is BB, then the genotype of the parent white plant will be bb."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel8,"Let’s see what happened during that first cross _ You will use a tool called a Punnett square, which graphically shows the possible combinations of the gametes of the parents _ In a Punnett square, you place the possible gametes from each parent along the top and left side of the square _ What you are representing here is the Law of Segregation: during meiosis I, the chromosome pair separates, resulting in haploid gametes _ Each gamete will have only one allele."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel9,"Then you combine the possible gametes with each other to see all possible combinations, as shown in this example _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel10,"As you can see, 100 percent of the offspring have the Bb genotype, but 100 percent also show the purple phenotype _ You might expect the offspring to show a phenotype that somehow blends the parental phenotypes _ Sometimes this happens, but in the case of these pea plants' flower color, the purple allele (B) is dominant over the white allele (b) _ Stated another way, the white allele (b) is recessive to the purple allele (B)."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel11,"In many, but not all, cases it is possible to pinpoint a phenotype to one allele _ Remember, alleles are variants of genes, and genes code for proteins _ In this example, the purple color may be due to an enzyme that produces a purple pigment _ If the allele codes for a mutated enzyme that does not perform as expected, the resulting flower would be white _ A flower with BB or Bb genotype has the normal enzyme — purple pigment is produced — and even the heterozygous flower, which has only one allele for the normal enzyme, produces enough pigment for the flower to be purple _ The bb flower, on the other hand, has no functioning enzyme, so the flower remains white."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel12,"There are some easily observable human traits that follow the Mendelian inheritance pattern, showing a dominant and a recessive allele _ Examples include unattached earlobes (dominant) versus attached earlobes (recessive) _ The widow’s peak hairline, a cleft chin, rolling tongue, and hitchhiker’s thumb are others _ Does the ability to roll your tongue make you more fit for survival? Not really! One common misconception is that dominant traits are more favorable from an evolutionary point of view _ Another is that dominant traits are more common _ We cannot stress enough that traits, and particularly human traits, are determined by complex interactions between genes and environment _ In the early days of genetics, simple observable traits were used to describe inheritance patterns _ Once the molecular basis of inheritance was established, scientists could tackle more complex interactions _ You will learn more about this in the Molecular Genetics unit _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_11,"There are two ways for organisms to reproduce: asexual and sexual _ Many organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and even some plants and animals, reproduce asexually _ During asexual reproduction, all of the genes in a cell are passed to its daughter cells _ This means that the resulting cells are clones or identical copies of the parental cell."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_12,"Asexual reproduction is efficient and fast _ However, it only provides one set of genes to adapt to the environment _ Think about it like a set of lottery numbers _ Do you have more chances of winning if you play only one number or if you play ten numbers? Sexual reproduction, in which the genes of two parents are combined, results in more genetic variability _ This enables offspring to deal more successfully with environmental change, although sexual reproduction is a more complex process and results in a smaller number of offspring _ Interestingly, certain organisms that can reproduce both asexually and sexually will choose sexual reproduction only when environmental conditions are not optimal _ That way, a smaller number of more variable, and thus more adaptable, offspring is produced _ In optimal conditions, however, asexual reproduction is the favored mechanism _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_13,"As you recall, genetic information is contained in DNA, which in eukaryotic cells are bound to special proteins called histones _ The combination of DNA and histone proteins is called chromatin _ During the S-phase of the cell cycle, the chromatin is loose, to facilitate DNA replication _ Chromatin can condense to form chromosomes during nuclear division _ Chromosomes have a typical appearance and can be organized in a karyotype."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_14,"Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 46) _ Of those 23 pairs, 22 are autosomes, and the 23rd pair are sex chromosomes _ Sex chromosomes can be of two types: X and Y _ Males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), while women have two copies of the X chromosome (XX)."

cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_16,"In the human lifecycle, haploid gametes produced during meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote, which goes through the process of mitosis to grow into an adult human _ When the adult human produces haploid gametes, the process can be repeated."
cell_repro_and_genetics,_u3_m3_Cell_Replic_Meiosis_17,This shuffling of the genetic material is one of the sources of genetic variability that makes meiosis such an important process.

cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid1,"After his first experiment with crossing involving one trait, Mendel conducted experiments looking at the inheritance of two traits _ For example, he crossed true-breeding plants that had yellow, round seeds with true-breeding plants that had green, wrinkled seeds _ The resulting F1 generation plants all produced yellow, round seeds."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid2,"The story became much more complicated when Mendel crossed the F1 generation plants with each other _ This is called a dihybrid cross, as it is a cross between two individuals, both of whom are heterozygous for two traits."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid3,"In the F2 generation, Mendel observed the original phenotypes (yellow/round, green/wrinkled) and two additional phenotypes: green/round and yellow/wrinkled _ The four alleles had combined with each other, independently of each other _ This outcome demonstrates the law of independent assortment."

cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid5,"As you remember from the Meiosis module, during meiosis I, after crossing-over, the chromosome pairs separate randomly _ This means that Y and y will separate, as will R and r _ But which goes to which gamete is random _ So the Y allele in a chromosome can be associated with a chromosome containing the R allele or the r allele, and the R allele can be paired with a chromosome containing the Y allele or the y allele _ Therefore, there are four possible gametes in a dihybrid cross."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid6,Fill in the following Punnett square for a dihybrid cross.
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid7,"There are exceptions to the law of independent assortment _ We know now that peas have seven chromosomes, and Mendel happened to study traits coded by genes on different chromosomes, or on distant positions of the same chromosome, which assort independently due to frequent crossing-over _ Genes that are very close together on a chromosome do not assort independently, and are said to be linked _ The closer they are, the more probable that the gametes will receive parental combinations of alleles of those genes _ All the genes in a chromosome are called a linkage group _ Peas have seven linkage groups."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid8,"An example of linked traits in humans is human hair and skin color _ You may have noticed that red hair and fair skin are often inherited together _ This is because the genes for these traits are very close to each other on the same chromosome, and they rarely recombine _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_dihybrid9,"Mendel published his results in 1866, but few read his work, and no one understood it entirely _ When he became abbot of the monastery in 1871, he retired from science, and he died in 1884, unaware that his pioneering experiments would form the foundation for the study of modern genetics."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel_summary1,"For centuries, humans observed traits in themselves and in the animals and plants surrounding them _ They realized that they were passed on from one generation to another, although not in a completely unequivocal way _ Breeders of plants and animals figured out ways to enhance their traits by selecting individuals with the desired characteristics and crossing them with each other _ But it was not until the experiments of Gregor Mendel in the nineteenth century that patterns of inheritance started to become clearer _ Based on a simple model, the pea plant, with easily observable phenotypes governing flower colors, seed shape, and so on, he proposed that hereditary information was passed along in discrete units he called genes (at that time DNA was not known), and that genes could have two alternatives or alleles _ According to Mendel’s laws, alleles segregate during sexual reproduction, and combine independently from each other _ We know now that genes are DNA sequences found in chromosomes, and the segregation is due to the process of meiosis you have already learned about _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity_mendel_summary2,"Mendel also coined the terms dominant and recessive to describe the expression of only one form of the gene when both are present in the same organism (that is, when an organism is heterozygous for the gene)."

cell_repro_and_genetics,ccbio_definitions_u732,"Describes a trait associated to alleles located on sex chromosomes, most commonly it is X-linked."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_incomplete_dominance1,"Gregor Mendel’s experiments that you studied earlier involve simple dominance, in which the offspring will show a trait from either one parent or the other, not a blend of those traits _ In a case of simple dominance, crossing a red flower and a white one will produce a red flower, not a pink flower _ If you think about traits that children inherit from their parents, you will realize that this does not always happen _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_incomplete_dominance2,"Continued genetic research has revealed that inheritance is usually more complicated than simple dominance _ Some genes follow Mendelian patterns of inheritance, but many are governed instead by non-Mendelian inheritance _ Mendel himself realized this when he looked at species and characteristics beyond the scope of his research _ For example, although the cross of a true-bred purple-flowered pea plant with a true-bred white-flowered pea plant will result in purple flowers, the cross of true-bred red flower and true-bred white flower snapdragons will result in offspring with pink flowers _ If the pink snapdragons are crossed with each other, pink, red, and white flowers will appear in a 2:1:1 ratio, respectively _ How can this happen?"
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_incomplete_dominance3,"In this inheritance pattern, called incomplete dominance, the heterozygous genotype exhibits an intermediate phenotype _ In the snapdragon example, the intermediate phenotype is pink _ What is the difference between the purple heterozygotes of the pea flowers and the pink heterozygotes of the snapdragon flowers? Think about what an allele is: a variation of a gene containing the recipe for a protein _ In the flower color example, this protein could be an enzyme involved in the synthesis of a pigment _ In the case of the pea plant, the presence of a single allele in the heterozygous plant was enough to provide all the pigment needed to give the dominant purple color _ However, in the case of the snapdragon, the presence of only one allele does not provide enough pigment to give the flower a fully red hue—but there is enough pigment to tint it partially, thus providing the pink color of the heterozygous flower."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_incomplete_dominance4,"The following Punnett square represents incomplete dominance _ Fill in the genotypes and the corresponding phenotypes for the offspring of these parents, both of which have a genotype of Rr."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance1,"So far, You've only learned about genes with two alleles — that is, two options for a gene coming from either parent — present in a chromosome pair _ However, more than two alleles may be present in a population, resulting in what is referred to as a multiple-allele system _ Human A, B, and O blood groups exist due to three possible alleles of the ABO gene, which codes for a protein that modifies carbohydrates present on red blood cells (Components of the Membrane) _ The A and B alleles code for two versions of the protein, while the O allele is mutated and does not code for a functional protein _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance2,"A and B are codominant, which means that if the individual has both A and B alleles, he will be of AB blood group, which expresses both proteins _ On the other hand, O is recessive, so only the homozygous recessive individuals will have an O phenotype (blood group O) _ When representing the three different alleles for blood type we represent the codominant alleles by A and B for the A protein and B protein respectively _ The recessive O allele is represented by lower case ‘i.’ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance3,"When referring to human blood groups, you may have heard references to “A negative” or “O positive.” The term “positive/negative” here refers to the presence or absence of a membrane glycoprotein called Rh _ The Rh glycoprotein was named after Rhesus monkeys because some of the original studies on the Rh factor were done on these animals _ The expression of this protein presents a simple dominance pattern, with the presence of the Rh molecule (Rh positive) being dominant over the absence (Rh negative) _ So a person's blood is said to be A positive (A+) if both A and Rh molecules are present on that person’s red blood cells."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance4,"If the immune system of an Rh negative person is exposed to Rh positive red blood cells, it will produce antibodies against the Rh molecule _ The next time the immune system meets Rh positive red blood cells, the antibodies will attack and destroy them _ This scenario is rather unusual, except when a mother who is Rh negative is carrying an Rh positive baby _ After the first pregnancy, her immune system develops anti-Rh antibodies, and in subsequent pregnancies these antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the red blood cells of the fetus _ This results in hemolytic anemia, and could seriously affect the fetus _ Luckily, Rh negative mothers today receive an anti-Rh antibody injection that prevents development of the anti-Rh response."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance5,"Another example of codominance is sickle cell anemia and sickle cell trait _ In sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin — the protein that transports oxygen in the blood — is defective, giving the red blood cells a characteristic “sickled” appearance _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance6,"A change in one amino acid in the structure of hemoglobin makes it defective: the blood cells cannot transport oxygen effectively, and they accumulate in the blood vessels _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_codominance7,"Patients homozygous for the defective allele have sickle cell anemia _ Heterozygotes (having one “good” and one “bad” allele for hemoglobin) will present both types of hemoglobin _ That condition is called sickle cell trait, where the individuals will present many red blood cells that become sickled under conditions of extreme physical exertion or low atmospheric oxygen _ So while the phenotype can be considered intermediate, in fact it is actually a case of codominance _ Interestingly, the sickle cell trait protects against malaria infection, and therefore remains prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is endemic."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic1,"Some traits, such as skin color and height, are determined by multiple genes _ In humans, skin color is determined by at least three different genes, and probably more _ This concept is called polygenic inheritance _ Variation along a continuum often indicates that a trait has polygenic inheritance _ Most visible traits are polygenic, and their genetic patterns are rather complicated."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic2,In some instances the polygenic effect is rather straightforward _ This situation is called epistasis _ In epistasis:
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic3, The products of two or more genes result in a certain phenotype _ The expression of one gene masks or changes the expected phenotype of one or more other genes _ 
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic4,"For instance, in Labrador retrievers, the allele for black fur color (B) is dominant with regard to the allele for brown (“chocolate”) fur color (b) _ However, there are also yellow Labs _ The coats of yellow labs are created through epistasis _ Another gene, E/e, is in play _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic5,"The reason for this distinction is an interaction between the two genes _ The B gene is involved in the synthesis of the pigment melanin: B results in a black, and b in a brown color _ The E gene is related to melanin deposition in the fur: E causes melanin to be deposited, and e suppresses melanin deposits _ Being homozygous for e — that is, having the ee genotype (no melanin deposition) — results in fur with neither brown nor black pigment, which appears yellow, independent of the black or chocolate allele (B or b) _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic6,"The Punnett square below represents a dihybrid cross for Labrador retrievers, similar to the one that you saw in the previous module _ Based on the given genotype of the offspring and that Labradors exhibit polygenic inheritance, drag the corresponding phenotype that goes with each genotype _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic7,"Many single genes can have numerous different effects, rather than just two _ This capability is called pleiotropy _ In the 1930s, for instance, researchers found a gene in chickens that leads most obviously to feathers that curl out, but that also (and less visibly) leads to increased metabolism, blood flow, body temperature, and digestive capacity, as well as fewer eggs laid _ This pleiotropic gene is called the “frizzle” gene because of its effect on the appearance of the chickens."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_polygenetic8,"Another gene known to have pleiotropic effects in humans is fibrillin-1, which codes for a connective tissue protein _ Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene _ People with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and thin with long arms and legs, and they are at risk for heart disease and eye problems _ The symptoms can be treated individually, and people with Marfan syndrome may have normal life spans."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_spotlight1,"Characteristics that are influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors are called multifactorial _ The idea of “nature versus nurture” — in other words, the relative influence of genetics versus environmental factors — has been and still is debated _ Just looking at the genes of a given organism will not determine how that organism will develop and act _ Even identical twins will show different characteristics, depending on the environment in which they live _ Everyone is a product of their environment as well as their genetics."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_spotlight2,"Even when influenced by the environment, phenotypes have a normal range of expression _ For instance, human height varies based on nutrition and genetics, but not many people are shorter than 4½ feet or taller than 7 feet _ The range of phenotypic possibilities is called the norm of reaction _ Hydrangeas, for example, may be blue, pink, or purple, but they are never naturally orange _ Hydrangeas are blue in acidic soil with available aluminum, and they are pink in alkaline soil without available aluminum _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_spotlight3,"Some human characteristics have a narrow norm of reaction, such as blood type _ Others have a wide norm of reaction, such as the number of blood cells in humans, which varies depending on factors that include physical fitness, presence or history of infections, and even the altitude at which a person lives _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_spotlight4,"The environment also affects human genes _ Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that acts inside brain cells, lowers anxiety and depression during traumatic times _ Mutations in the serotonin transporter gene may cause a reduced ability to cope with stress _ That does not mean that the person is always depressed, but if the environment produces stress, the person may become depressed more easily than a person with unmutated serotonin transporter genes."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_spotlight5,"You already learned about PKU, a pleiotropic disorder caused by defects in a single gene coding for an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine _ Newborns are tested for this defect very early in life, so that if the results are positive, they can be given a diet limiting phenylalanine ingestion _ That way, the toxic buildup is prevented and the children can develop normally _ PKU is an example in which environmental factors can modify gene expression."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_summary1,"The relationship between alleles is not always as simple as dominant/recessive _ Sometimes the resulting phenotype is an intermediate of the dominant and the recessive phenotypes (as in incomplete dominance) _ Other times, two dominant alleles are expressed concurrently (as in codominance)."
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_summary2,"In the Mendelian pattern, it is possible to pinpoint a gene/allele coding for a specific protein to a particular trait _ There are, however, more complex patterns to consider as well, such as epistasis, in which genes can influence each other’s expression, and polygenic inheritance, in which more than one gene is responsible for a particular trait _ "
cell_repro_and_genetics,genetics_heredity2_summary3,"It is important to remember that genes alone do not determine everything — the environment plays an important role in shaping characteristics, too _ There is lots to explore in the “nature versus nurture” relationship _ "

stored_info_dna_protein,nucleic_acids_intro1,"In 1953, a group of scientists contributed to one of the most significant scientific discoveries in history when they determined the structure of DNA, a nucleic acid that is the hereditary material in a cell _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,nucleic_acids_intro2,"Nucleic acids are macromolecules that carry out two main functions in the cell: storage of genetic information and synthesis of proteins _ Two types of nucleic acids specialize in these functions: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) _ DNA is the genetic material that stores information for making proteins in all living organisms _ Some viruses store their genetic information in RNA instead of DNA _ This may seem like an exception to the universal use of DNA as genetic material; however, recall that viruses are not cellular, and are not considered living organisms _ The functions of nucleic acids are summarized in the table below."
stored_info_dna_protein,nucleic_acids_intro3,"A nucleic acid consists of a chain of nucleotides _ There are different kinds of nucleotides that can be linked to build the different nucleic acids _ DNA is probably the most familiar nucleic acid, but in this module, you will also learn about RNA _ The nucleotides that are used to build RNA molecules are different from the nucleotides that are used to build DNA _ You'll also take a look at a very special nucleotide — ATP, which acts as the energy currency of the cell."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_21,"Like any polymer, nucleic acids are made up of repeating subunits or monomers _ The subunits of nucleic acids are called nucleotides _ Each nucleotide contains three building blocks: a phosphate, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base _ The nitrogenous base is a type of organic molecule that consists of one or two ring structures _ Note that the term “base” is used here to refer to a specific part of the nucleic acid structure; the meaning is very different from the use of the term “base” in the discussion of pH and acid-base chemistry _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_22,"There are five different nitrogenous bases that can be found in various nucleotides _ In DNA, you will find these nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) _ In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U)."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_23,"Nucleotides can also differ in the type of sugar they contain _ All sugars found in nucleotides are pentose sugars, which means they have five carbons; however, there can be different pentose sugars _ For example, DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose _ RNA, on the other hand, contains ribose."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_24,"Finally, nucleotides can differ in the number of phosphate groups they contain _ DNA and RNA nucleotides contain just one phosphate _ But a very common nucleotide used for energy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contains three phosphates _ We will look at this molecule in greater detail in the Metabolism unit."
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro1,"This course has looked closely at the water molecule because it is vital to life _ Water covers 70 percent of the Earth’s surface and the cell, the fundamental unit of life, consists of 70 to 95 percent water _ In this module, we will examine one very small (and simple) substance that, when dissolved in water, can have an enormous impact on life: the hydrogen ion (H+) _ Hydrogen ions are hydrogen atoms that have had their electrons removed _ What remains is only a single proton _ The simplicity of this ion, however, is quite misleading _ In this module, we will investigate the dynamics of H+ and learn more about the effects H+ can have on solutions _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro3,"The story of acids and bases begins with water (H2O) _ Water in the liquid state is highly dynamic _ Not only are hydrogen bonds constantly forming and breaking between water molecules, but individual water molecules are breaking apart and then reforming again to make water _ When they break apart, a hydrogen ion (H+) is transferred to another water molecule to make a hydronium ion (H3O+), leaving a hydroxide ion (OH-) from the original water molecule _ This dynamic reaction can be represented by this chemical equation: H2O + H2O H3O+ + OH-."
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro4,To simplify things we will represent the hydronium ion as a hydrogen ion (H3O+ = H+) in the following discussion _ 
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro5,"Notice that the two arrows point in opposite directions _ This simply means that the equation can move in either direction _ In other words, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions can combine to form water, or water can break down into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions _ These two reactions are in equilibrium, so at any instant in a sample of pure water there are equal concentrations of H+ and OH- _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro6,"Pure water is said to be “neutral.” This means it is neither acidic nor basic because it has equal concentrations of H+ and OH- _ Some substances can dissolve in water and they will not disturb the balance between H+ and OH- _ However, other compounds disturb this balance _ Some compounds, when added to water, cause an increase of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution _ These compounds are called acids _ Other compounds, when added to water, cause a decrease in hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution _ These compounds are called bases _ Some bases accept H+ directly, but others release hydroxide ions (OH-) that then combine with H+ to produce water _ The end result is the same _ When the base is dissolved in water, the concentration of H+ ions goes down _ A compound that does not result in a net gain or loss of hydrogen ions (H+) when in aqueous solution is said to be neutral; it does not alter the acidity of the water _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,biochem_pH_intro7,Understanding acids and bases is important to biology because living organisms must maintain homeostasis (balance) and cannot tolerate drastic changes in the acidity of their body fluids or cytoplasm _ Cellular functions are disrupted if these fluids become too acidic or basic _ 
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_31,"Let’s examine the structure of a nucleic acid polymer _ How are nucleotide building blocks connected to each other? The alternating ""phosphate - sugar - phosphate"" building blocks form a backbone of the linear polymer _ Bases are attached to the backbone via the sugars and are equivalent to the “side chains” of amino acids in proteins."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_32,"Just as with proteins, a DNA (or RNA) strand has directionality: one end is different than the other _ In the case of proteins, an amino group is found on one end and a carboxylate group is found on the other end _ Since it is the order of bases that carries out the function of DNA (information storage), we often represent DNA as just a sequence of bases (GAGGCT) and do not bother representing the backbone _ By convention, the first letter is the base at the 5’ (five prime) end of the DNA strand _ Thus, the sequence GAGGCT is shorthand for 5’-GAGGCT-3’ _ Determine how this directionally occurs in DNA in the following learn by doing."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_51,"All DNA found in living organisms comes in sets of two polymers or strands, usually referred to as double-stranded DNA _ Some viruses are an exception to this rule and contain single-stranded DNA as their genetic material _ The discovery that DNA structure is a double helix (two strands wound around each other) is considered one of the greatest discoveries in science _ Understanding of the structure of DNA opened up a whole new realm of biological and biomedical research (molecular biology) and led to the development of new technologies in science and medicine _ Let’s examine the structure of DNA using the activity below."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_52,"DNA structure is an antiparallel double helix: the two DNA strands run in opposite directions _ The sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside, and the bases are on the inside of the helix _ The two strands are held together by base pairing: hydrogen bonding between specific bases _ Adenine (a purine) always pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine); guanine (a purine) always pairs with cytosine (a pyrimidine) _ These base pairing rules (A-T, G-C) are very important to the structure and function of DNA."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_71,"Two of the most important nucleic acids are DNA and RNA _ DNA contains the instructions for building proteins _ RNA, on the other hand, is involved in actually building the proteins _ Because of these different functions, the structures of the two molecules are very different _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_72,Compare DNA and RNA and answer the questions about these structures.
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_91,"In this module you learned that nucleotides are the monomers that make up the nucleic acid polymers _ Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide _ It consists of a single adenosine (the base adenine and the sugar ribose), linked to three phosphate ions _ ATP has an essential function: it is the universal energy source; it acts as a general energy source for most cellular activities _ Photosynthetic organisms (primarily plants and bacteria) get their energy from the sun _ Animals get their energy second- or third-hand from digesting plants and other organisms (i.e., the food and other nutrients we eat) _ Regardless of the source, for living organisms energy is converted to the chemical bond energy contained in the ATP molecule _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_92,"Cells of all organisms make ATP by breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins _ ATP is a relatively unstable molecule; consequently, it is never used for the long-term storage of energy in the cell _ This job goes to other more stable compounds, like fats and sugars _ However, ATP is specialized for direct and rapid transfers of energy _ The bond between the second and the third phosphates can be broken in a reaction producing ADP (adenosine diphosphate) with 'di' indicating two phosphate groups _ When the bond between the first and second phosphates is broken, energy is released, and produces AMP (adenosine monophosphate) with mono indicating one phosphate group _ Energy is releaased when ATP reacts with water to form ADP or AMP _ The energy released in these reactions can be used for chemical reactions (such as protein synthesis), molecule transport, or cellular work (such as muscle contractions) _ Conversely, if there is a surplus of energy, specialized reactions can produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate, storing the energy temporarily before being used for other processes."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_93,The ADP generated when energy is released is recycled back to ATP using energy gained from the metabolic process _ Large amounts of ATP are consumed while providing energy for biological functions _ You will learn more details about how energy is stored in ATP and released in the unit dedicated to metabolism.
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_94,"To answer this question, you first need to know that in chemistry, atoms or molecules are often counted _ Sometimes you use a word to represent the quantity of something _ For example, you might call 12 cookies a dozen cookies _ You can count cookies by the dozen _ In chemistry, we count molecules by the mole _ While one dozen is equal to 12, one mole is equal to 6.02 x 10^23 _ In other words, one mole of molecules is equal to 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules! "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_101,"Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis _ Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group _ There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA _ DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring _ It has a double-helix structure with the two strands running in opposite directions and complementary to each other _ RNA is composed of a single strand and it is involved in protein synthesis _ RNA is composed of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group _ ATP is a nucleotide composed of an adenine base, ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups; it provides energy for cellular activities _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_102,"Take some time to review the main concepts in this module _ When you are ready, check your understanding of nucleic acids by taking the quiz linked below."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_intro_v11," In the Classical Genetics unit, you learned about the mechanisms of inheritance, focusing mostly on the organism and population levels in the hierarchy of life _ In the Molecular Genetics unit, you will learn about the molecular basis of traits that characterize the organisms _ You will develop an understanding on the molecular level of how genetic information is organized and used by living organisms."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_intro_v12,"If we compare traits of individuals within species, we find that they share certain traits, but they also show many differences among individuals _ Fore example, rice (pictured below) shows variation in shape and color of seeds/grains _ People also come in different shapes and sizes _ What determines physical traits that characterize a person: hair color, eye color, height, weight? How about behavior: some people are risk-takers, others get easily anxious; some people love to be in large noisy crowds, others prefer quiet and solitude _ What is more important in determining physical and behavioral traits — genetics or environment? This classic “nature vs _ nurture” argument should not be phrased as “either/or,” because the answer is “both.” The interactions between genes and environment determine the traits."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_intro_v13," A better question to ask is “To what extent is each trait determined by genetics and to what extent by environment?” The answer will vary by trait and is still being researched _ It is not a trivial question to answer, and the numbers below are only rough estimates."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_intro_v14," In Molecular Genetics, first you will learn about the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information (central dogma of molecular biology), whereby the information content in DNA sequences, called genes, is ultimately converted to a protein _ Then you will look at the structure of genes and genomes and at the interactions between genes and the environment _ Finally, you will examine how humans are able to manipulate genes through biotechnology."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA_function_and_replication_intro1,"If you look at people around you, you will probably notice a fairly large variation in height _ Some people are taller than you, while others are shorter than you _ Consider this trait as an example that you want to understand on the molecular level _ What kinds of molecules may be involved in determining a person’s height? If you and your parents are relatively short (or tall), you may say that you inherited the short (or tall) stature from your parents _ What molecule is involved in the transmission of information from one generation to the next? DNA _ How does information contained in DNA affect your height? One possible explanation is that your DNA contains a gene encoding a protein called growth hormone _ This protein is produced by the pituitary gland, travels to other tissues, and delivers a signal for the cells to grow and divide _ Changes in the amount of protein produced or the sequence of amino acids in the protein can affect the function _ If bone and muscle cells receive only a small number of signal molecules, the person will end up with a short stature _ If they receive a large number of signal molecules, the person may end up being very tall _ For a signaling protein (hormone) to deliver the signal, there must be a protein that can bind the hormone and receive the signal (receptor protein) _ The variation in height will result from any of the following:"
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA_function_and_replication_intro2, The amount of signaling protein produced _ The amount of receptor produced in different tissues _ How tightly the hormone and the receptor bind to each other; small variations in specific amino acids of either molecule can change the binding interaction _ 
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA_function_and_replication_intro3,"Note that a person who inherits “tall” genes may never grow very tall because of illness or inadequate nutrition _ Conversely, a person who inherits a faulty growth hormone gene may grow relatively tall if he or she is treated with growth hormone _ These are examples of how environment and genes interact to produce traits and phenotypes."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA_function_and_replication_intro4,"In this module, you will learn about how genetic information is stored in DNA and copied for the next generation _ You will also look at a practical application of the process of DNA replication called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) _ In the next module, you will learn how the genetic information stored in genes is expressed, resulting in the variety of traits and phenotypes of all organisms."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_11,"Nucleic acids are macromolecules that carry out two main functions in the cell: storage of genetic information and synthesis of proteins _ Two types of nucleic acids specialize in these functions: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) _ DNA is the genetic material that stores information for making proteins in all living organisms _ Some viruses store their genetic information in RNA instead of DNA _ This may seem as an exception to the universal use of DNA as genetic material; however, viruses are not cellular, and are not considered living organisms _ DNA is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in two cellular organelles: chloroplasts, and mitochondria _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_12,"In prokaryotes, DNA is not enclosed in a separate compartment, but found in the cytoplasm."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_13,"Regardless of where DNA is stored in the cell, it contains instructions for building proteins _ For protein synthesis to occur, genetic information stored in DNA must first be copied into RNA _ In eukaryotic cells, RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place _ Thus, while both RNA and DNA can contain instructions for making proteins, DNA is used for storage of this information, while RNA is directly involved in making proteins."
stored_info_dna_protein,bc_nucleic_acids_14,"To understand in more detail how nucleic acids function in transmission of genetic information and in protein synthesis, you must first consider the structures of these molecules and the relationship between structure and function."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA1,"The genetic information of an organism is stored in DNA molecules _ How can one kind of molecule contain all the instructions for making complicated living beings like ourselves? What component or feature of DNA can contain this information? It has to come from the nitrogen bases, because, as you already know, the backbone of all DNA molecules is the same _ But there are only four bases found in DNA : G, A, C, and T _ The sequence of these four bases can provide all the instructions needed to build any living organism _ It might be hard to imagine that 4 different “letters” can communicate so much information _ But think about the English language, which can represent a huge amount of information using just 26 letters _ Even more profound is the binary code used to write computer programs _ This code contains only ones and zeros, and think of all the things your computer can do _ The DNA alphabet can encode very complex instructions using just four letters, though the messages end up being really long _ For example, the E _ coli bacterium carries its genetic instructions in a DNA molecule that contains more than five million nucleotides _ The human genome (all the DNA of an organism) consists of around three billion nucleotides divided up between 23 DNA molecules, or chromosomes."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA2,"The information stored in the order of bases is organized into genes: each gene contains information for making a functional product _ The genetic information is first copied to another nucleic acid polymer, RNA (ribonucleic acid), preserving the order of the nucleotide bases _ Genes that contain instructions for making proteins are converted to messenger RNA (mRNA) _ Some specialized genes contain instructions for making functional RNA molecules that don’t make proteins _ These RNA molecules function by affecting cellular processes directly; for example some of these RNA molecules regulate the expression of mRNA _ Other genes produce RNA molecules that are required for protein synthesis, transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA3,"In order for DNA to function effectively at storing information, two key processes are required _ First, information stored in the DNA molecule must be copied, with minimal errors, every time a cell divides _ This ensures that both daughter cells inherit the complete set of genetic information from the parent cell _ Second, the information stored in the DNA molecule must be translated, or expressed _ In order for the stored information to be useful, cells must be able to access the instructions for making specific proteins, so the correct proteins are made in the right place at the right time."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA4,Both copying and reading the information stored in DNA relies on base pairing between two nucleic acid polymer strands _ Recall that DNA structure is a double helix (see figure below).
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA5,"Structure of DNA double helix _ On the left: Sugar-phosphate backbone is shown in yellow, specific base pairings via hydrogen bonds (red lines) are colored in green and purple (A-T pair) and red and blue (C-G) _ On the right: Three-dimensional structure of DNA double helix _ Click on the checkboxes to highight the A-T and C-G basepairs _ Click on 'Spin On' to automatically rotate the DNA helix structure _ Graphic by Madeleine Price Ball (DNA chemical structure) CC-BY-SA-2.0"
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA6,"The sugar deoxyribose with the phosphate group forms the scaffold or backbone of the molecule (highlighted in yellow in the figure above) _ Bases point inward _ Complementary bases form hydrogen bonds with each other within the double helix _ See how the bigger bases (purines) pair with the smaller ones (pyrimidines) _ This keeps the width of the double helix constant _ More specifically, A pairs with T and C pairs with G _ As we discuss the function of DNA in subsequent sections, keep in mind that there is a chemical reason for specific pairing of bases."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA7,"To illustrate the connection between information in DNA and an observable characteristic of an organism, let’s consider a gene that provides the instructions for building the hormone insulin _ Insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels _ The insulin gene contains instructions for assembling the protein insulin from individual amino acids _ Changing the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule can change the amino acids in the final protein, leading to protein malfunction _ If insulin does not function correctly, it might be unable to bind to another protein (insulin receptor) _ On the organismal level of organization, this molecular event (change of DNA sequence) can lead to a disease state — in this case, diabetes."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_DNA8,"The order of nucleotides in a gene (in DNA) is the key to how information is stored _ For example, consider these two words: stable and tables _ Both words are built from the same letters (subunits), but the different order of these subunits results in very different meanings _ In DNA, the information is stored in units of 3 letters _ Use the following key to decode the encrypted message _ This should help you to see how information can be stored in the linear order of nucleotides in DNA."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication1,"Before a cell can divide, it must first make a copy or replica of its DNA through a process called DNA replication _ This process occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle, so by the time the cell enters the mitotic phase, there are two copies of the DNA molecule _ This process of DNA replication takes place in the nucleus of the cell in eukaryotes, where the DNA molecule is found _ It also occurs in the mitochondria in animal cells and chloroplasts in plant cells."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication2,"Think about this: it is critical that the copies of the DNA are exactly like the original, so the daughter cells are identical to the parent cells _ There may be changes to DNA sequence by mutations (as you will see in another section), and meiosis introduces some genetic variability when gametes are produced _ But for unicellular organisms or for somatic cells, DNA replication is a process that requires high fidelity."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication3,"The process of DNA replication is catalyzed by a type of enzyme called DNA polymerase (poly meaning many, mer meaning pieces, and ase meaning enzyme; so an enzyme that attaches many pieces of DNA) _ Observe the figure below: the double helix of the original DNA molecule separates (blue) and new strands are made to match the separated strands _ The result will be two DNA molecules, each containing an old and a new strand _ Therefore, DNA replication is called semiconservative _ The term semiconservative refers to the fact that half of the original molecule (one of the two strands in the double helix) is “conserved” in the new molecule _ The original strand is referred to as the template strand because it provides the information, or template, for the newly synthesized strand."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication4,"DNA replication relies on the double-stranded nature of the molecule _ One double stranded DNA molecule, when replicated, will become two double-stranded molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand _ You remember that the two strands of DNA run antiparallel: one from the 5’ to the 3’, and the other from the 3’ to the 5’ _ The synthesis of the new DNA strand can only happen in one direction: from the 5’ to the 3’ end _ In other words, the new bases are always added to the 3’ end of the newly synthesized DNA strand _ So if the new nucleotide is always added to the 3’ end of an existing nucleotide, where does the first nucleotide come from? In fact, DNA polymerase needs an “anchor” to start adding nucleotides: a short sequence of DNA or RNA that is complementary to the template strand will work to provide a free 3’ end _ This sequence is called a primer."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication5,"How does DNA polymerase know in what order to add nucleotides? Specific base pairing in DNA is the key to copying the DNA: if you know the sequence of one strand, you can use base pairing rules to build the other strand _ Bases form pairs (base pairs) in a very specific way _ The figure shows how A (adenine) pairs with T (thymine) and G (guanine) pairs with C (cytosine) _ It is important to remember that this binding is specific: T pairs with A, but not with C _ The molecular recognition occurs because of the ability of bases to form specific hydrogen bonds: atoms align just right to make hydrogen bonds possible _ Also note that a larger base (purine, A or G) always pairs with a smaller base (pyrimidine, C or T)."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_replication6,"Now that you understand the basics of DNA replication, we can add a bit of complexity _ The two strands of DNA have to be temporarily separated from each other; this job is done by a special enzyme, helicase, that helps unwind and separate the DNA helices _ Another issue is that the DNA polymerase only works in one direction along the strand (5’ to 3’), but the double-stranded DNA has two strands oriented in opposite directions _ This problem is solved by synthesizing the two strands slightly differently: one new strand grows continuously, the other in bits and pieces _ Short fragments of RNA are used as primers for the DNA polymerase."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR1,"You may remember from the movie Jurassic Park how the DNA of a dinosaur was recreated from a tiny amount of blood from a mosquito trapped in amber _ While (so far) this is not possible in real life, the idea is based on one of the most useful tools for the manipulation of DNA: the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR _ This technique was invented by Kary Mullis in 1983 _ PCR uses repeated cycles of DNA polymerase activity to amplify, or make many copies of, a small segment of DNA known as the target DNA _ The target DNA resides within a larger DNA molecule that acts as a template _ The amplified DNA, or PCR product, can also serve as a template, leading to a “chain reaction” that doubles the amount of PCR product after each cycle _ Consequently, PCR can be used to amplify small amounts of DNA from forensic samples or historical artifacts _ When scientists have a larger sample of DNA, they can determine the base sequence of the sample and use the data to compare the DNA sequences of different individuals _ This process can help forensic scientists figure out the identity of a person who left blood at a crime scene _ It can also help decide paternity disputes _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR2,"PCR is essentially DNA replication, and just like DNA replication, PCR relies on the enzyme DNA polymerase _ Because DNA polymerase requires a primer before it can start building a new strand of DNA, this is the first thing scientists must find (or design) _ These primers will provide a starting point for the DNA polymerase _ In DNA replication, the primers are made of RNA nucleotides _ In PCR, the primers are short DNA molecules consisting of a specific sequence that flanks the right and left ends of the target DNA sequence _ The PCR product will contain the DNA sequences of the primers and the DNA between the primers."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR3,"Step 1: The DNA template and primers must be converted to single-strand DNA _ In DNA replication, DNA is separated by helicase _ In the lab, we can accomplish the same thing by heating the DNA to 98oC (almost boiling temperature)."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR4,"Step 2: In order for the DNA to be copied, the primers must bind _ 98°C is too hot for the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases to form _ Therefore, the reaction is cooled to ~55°C _ This allows the hydrogen bonds between the primer and the target DNA sequence to form."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR5,"Step 3: In step 3, the temperature is raised to ~78°C, which activates DNA polymerase and stimulates copying of the DNA _ The polymerase begins at the primer and copies the DNA to the end of the template."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR6,"After this process is complete, the temperature is again raised to 980C and a new cycle begins _ At the end of each cycle, the sample contains double the amount of DNA template _ "
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR7,Watch the following video to review the steps of PCR.
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_PCR8,"You might wonder how the DNA polymerase, as a protein, can resist such a high temperature _ In fact, the DNA polymerases used for PCR are derived from organisms that can live at extremely high temperatures _ The most common DNA polymerase used for PCR is called Taq, and it is found in the microbe Thermus aquaticus, which was first discovered in the Lower Geyser Basin at Yellowstone National Park."

stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application1,"Much of our DNA contains a number of short DNA segments that are repeated over and over again at different locations in our genome _ The number of these tandem repeats at each location in the genome can differ from individual to individual, with 5 to 20 percent of individuals having the same number of tandem repeats at the same location."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application2,"Variations in the number of tandem repeats are detected by the polymerase chain reaction, using primers that bind to unique sequences on the edges of the repeat."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application3,"If the two DNA samples show a different number of repeats, then the samples must have come from two different individuals _ If two DNA samples show the same number of repeats at one location, then there is a chance that the two DNA samples came from the same individual _ This is not a very reliable indication that the DNA samples came from the same individual, since a significant fraction of people can have the same number of tandem repeats at any one location in the chromosome _ To increase the reliability of a positive match between the two samples, a total of 13 different locations of tandem repeats are amplified, and the number of repeats at each location are compared _ If any of the 13 locations differ in the number of repeats, the two DNA samples came from different individuals _ However, if all 13 agree, there is a greater than 99.99 percent probability that the two DNA samples came from the same individual _ There is still a 0.01 percent chance that the DNA came from two different people who just happened to have the same number of tandem repeats at each of the 13 different locations."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application4,Use PCR to solve the following crime.
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application5,"A homicide has occurred, and you are trying to determine which of your suspects is most likely the culprit _ You collect blood from the crime scene, the victim, and each suspect _ You use PCR to amplify a region of tandem repeats in each DNA sample _ If there are more tandem repeats present in a DNA molecule, then the PCR product will be larger _ For instance, if Bob has seven repeats and Joe has only two, the PCR product from Bob’s DNA will be larger than the PCR product from Joe’s DNA _ The PCR products are separated using a technique called gel electrophoresis _ In this technique, DNA is placed in an electric field, and the DNA will move toward the positive electrode due to the negative charge on the DNA _ The DNA is forced to move through a crosslinked gel material _ Because smaller DNA molecules can move faster through the gel, this technique separates DNA molecules by size _ The distance of the DNA from the top of the gel is directly related to the size of the DNA, and therefore the number of tandem repeat _ An image of the gel is shown below."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_application6,"In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, Czar Nicholas II and his entire family were reportedly executed by the communists _ It was rumored at the time that two of the Czar’s children, Anastasia and Alexei, escaped and survived _ Later examination of the gravesite showed that two bodies were indeed missing, suggesting that the rumor was true _ A woman living in Germany, Ann, claimed that she was Anastasia _ DNA was obtained both from this woman and from a preserved blood sample belonging to the Czar (from a bloodstained shirt left over from an assassination attempt in Japan) _ PCR was used to amplify tandem repeats in two regions of the chromosome for both DNA samples, and the results are shown on the following gel."
stored_info_dna_protein,genetics_molecular_summary1,"DNA replication is essential for the continuity of genetic information throughout generations _ A cell that is preparing to divide will replicate its DNA, using a variety of enzymes working in concert _ Our understanding of DNA replication machinery has opened the door for a variety of advances, including the process of PCR _ PCR is used to make many copies of a small segment of DNA, and it can be used to identify individual DNA samples."

stored_info_dna_protein,ccbio_definitions_u618,"Due to degeneracy in the genetic code, more than one codon can code for the same amino acid _ Different organisms prefer one codon over another _ The process of codon optimization is the use of prefered codons when designing a gene to be expressed in a certain organism _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_intro1,"In the previous module, you learned how genetic information is stored in DNA and how it is passed in its totality to the next generation through the process of DNA replication _ You also read about PCR, a practical application of the DNA synthesis process _ In this module, we will focus on how this information is expressed _ Information contained in DNA is organized into genes, and each gene contains instructions for making a functional product: an RNA molecule or a protein _ This process of making the functional gene product is gene expression _ Different cells can contain the same DNA, but they express different genes and produce different proteins according to their function _ For example, red blood cells produce the protein hemoglobin, which is required for delivery of oxygen throughout the body _ Nerve cells contain the same DNA, but the hemoglobin gene is not expressed _ Instead, nerve cells make RNA copies of the genes that encode proteins required for signaling."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_intro2,"Even cells of the same type may express different genes and therefore produce different proteins, depending on their needs or environmental conditions _ For example, pancreatic beta cells produce insulin when blood sugar levels are increased _ Weightlifting increases muscle mass because it increases the production of proteins in the muscle cell _ Sex hormones are not produced until the beginning of puberty."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_intro3,"Multiple proteins expressed at specific levels at specific times in the cell determine the phenotype _ In this module, we will consider each of these processes in more detail, and we will conclude by looking at how changes in DNA sequence can affect the proteins encoded by DNA."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma1,The flow of information in a cell is described by the central dogma of molecular biology.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma2,"In eukaryotic cells, DNA stores the genetic information, which is passed from generation to generation through the process of DNA replication _ During replication, the whole sequence of DNA is copied _ In order for the information stored in DNA to be used by a living cell, the information must be expressed (gene expression) _ First, DNA is transcribed into one form of RNA called messenger RNA, or mRNA, through the process of transcription; then mRNA can be translated into an amino acid sequence forming a protein through the process of translation _ The ribosome translates the RNA sequence into a protein sequence, using three nucleotide bases to encode each amino acid _ DNA also encodes two other RNA molecules, transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) _ Although these RNA molecules do not directly encode proteins, they are both required for protein synthesis _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma3,"Transcription and translation are often confused _ Transcription is copying the information without changing the language _ This word comes from the same root as scribe, a word that describes someone who made copies of books in medieval times _ DNA and RNA are considered the same chemical “language” because their monomers are nucleotides."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma4,"Now, compare transcription to translation _ Just as translators of books change information from one language to another, the cellular process of translation changes information from the language of nucleic acids (using nucleotides as the monomers) into the language of proteins (using amino acids as monomers) _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma5,"Note that there are exceptions to the central dogma _ It is thought that during the dawn of life, RNA was the first molecule to store genetic information, and certain viruses still have RNA as their nucleic acid component _ In fact, certain viruses (among them the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV) have an enzyme capable of making DNA using RNA as a template _ However, you will recall that viruses are not cells, so it is safe to say that cells use DNA as their genetic material, and the flow of information goes as follows:"
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma6,"Gene expression, a process that is central to all living cells, can be summarized as a list of the following steps: "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma7, the DNA double helix is separated an enzyme called RNA polymerase moves along one strand and transcribes the information from one strand of DNA into a strand of RNA the ribosome translates the RNA sequence into a protein sequence _ 
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma8,"In eukaryotes, DNA and ribosomes reside in separate compartments, so an additional step is required: the transportation of RNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_dogma9,"The animation below illustrates the process of gene expression in eukaryotes _ Watch the animation, and then label still frames of the animation in the Learn By Doing activity."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_transcription1,"During gene expression, information stored in DNA is first copied (or transcribed) into RNA in a process called transcription _ Only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed, and the order of bases in RNA is determined by the base pairing of the ribonucleotides with the DNA _ In RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead _ As you know, A pairs with T, but because T is replaced by U in RNA, A pairs with U in RNA _ If the transcribed DNA strand has the sequence:"
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_transcription2,"and the bottom stand is used as a template to produce the RNA copy, the sequence of the RNA will be:"
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_transcription3,"Note that the transcribed RNA has exactly the same sequence as the upper DNA strand, but with T replaced by U."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_transcription4,"Determine whether the following describe transcription only, replication only or both."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation1,"The goal of translation is to make proteins _ The sequence of amino acids in a protein is specified (or encoded) by the sequence of bases in the nucleic acid _ You will recall that originally, the information is stored in DNA, but during transcription, an RNA copy of DNA is made _ RNA molecules that contain instructions for making a protein are called messenger RNA (mRNA) _ The sequence of bases in the mRNA determines which amino acid will be used in the protein _ Every three bases encode for a single amino acid _ These three bases are called codons or triplets."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation2,"The genetic code table below shows all possible combinations of three bases and the corresponding amino acids that the codons encode _ For example, the mRNA codon UGG encodes for the amino acid tryptophan _ Note that there are 64 codons and only 20 common amino acids _ Three of the codons do not specify amino acids, but instead signal the end of translation; these are called stop codons _ The remaining 61 codons encode for 20 amino acids _ Of these, the codon for the amino acid methionine, AUG, has a dual role _ It is used to signal the start of most protein-coding regions in the mRNA; thus, it is the start codon _ The same codon is used if methionine occurs at an internal position in the protein sequence."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation3,"The genetic code is redundant; some amino acids are specified by multiple codons _ This redundancy will become important when we try to predict how changes in nucleotide sequences affect the amino acid sequences of proteins _ Remarkably, the genetic code table is almost universal, meaning that most organisms, from bacteria to humans, specify the same amino acids using the same codons _ As a result, genes from one type of organism can be transferred to, and expressed in, the cells of another organism _ You will learn more about these kinds of technologies later in this unit."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation4,Examine the genetic code table and complete the Learn By Doing activity to make sure you understand how to use the table.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation5,"This table summarizes the amino acids that result from each codon on mRNA _ The first letter in the codon is on the left _ The second is on the top, and the third is on the right."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation6,"The genetic code table allows us to convert the information contained in a nucleic acid into an amino acid sequence _ How does the cell do this during translation? Translation from one language to another requires a dictionary, a book that connects words in two different languages _ In the cell, we need a molecule that connects codons and amino acids _ That molecule is transfer RNA (tRNA) _ Each tRNA contains three bases that can pair with a particular codon in mRNA (complementary base pairing) _ Each tRNA also carries a specific amino acid _ The tRNA binds mRNA via base pairing and brings the correct amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation7,The last type of RNA molecule that is critical for translation is ribosomal RNA (rRNA) _ rRNAs are components of the ribosome _ The ribosome is a large macromolecular complex composed of rRNA and ribosomal proteins _ The ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids _ Some ribosomes are located in the cytosol and translate cytosolic proteins _ Some ribosomes are attached to membranes; these ribosomes translate proteins destined to be inserted into the membrane or secreted outside the cell.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation8,"To summarize, three types of RNA carry out distinct roles in translation: mRNA encodes the protein, tRNA brings amino acids to mRNA, and rRNA is a component of the ribosome required for catalysis."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_translation9,"In the exercise below, you will simulate the process of transcription and translation and build a small protein _ Complete the activity and then answer the questions below."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation1,"None of the processes discussed so far are free of errors _ Errors can be made during transcription if incorrect nucleotides are incorporated into the growing RNA strands _ Errors can happen during translation if incorrect amino acids are inserted into a growing protein, or if translation is terminated too soon _ Errors during gene expression have generally short-lived effects and can be overcome by additional RNA or protein synthesis _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation2,"Errors during DNA replication can have a much longer lasting effect _ If incorrect nucleotides are incorporated into a newly synthesized DNA strand, the error may be passed on to future generations _ Such heritable changes are referred to as mutations _ Some mutations happen due to large scale rearrangements of DNA molecules that involve thousands or millions of nucleotides _ We will limit our discussion here to small-scale changes that involve one or a few nucleotides in the coding sequence of a gene _ These mutations include substitution of a single nucleotide base and insertion or deletion of one or more bases _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation3,Let us consider how different types of mutations affect the proteins encoded by DNA _ The sentence below represents a protein-coding gene _ Each three letter word carries some meaning – equivalent to each amino acid being encoded by a three-letter codon in DNA.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation4," Silent mutations _ A silent mutation changes the letter, but not the meaning _ Recall that the genetic code is redundant: multiple combinations of three bases can encode the same amino acid _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation5, Missense mutations _ A missense mutation changes a letter in DNA and also changes the encoded amino acid _ It changes the meaning of the message as below: 
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation6," Nonsense mutations _ A nonsense mutation changes an amino acid codon to a stop codon, terminating transcription: "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation7," Frameshift mutations _ A frameshift mutation occurs when one or two bases are inserted into or deleted from a sequence _ As a result, subsequent codons are read incorrectly in new groupings of three bases each: "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation8,Deletion of one nucleotide: introduces frame shift
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation9,"Deletion of three nucleotides removes information, but no frame shift."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation10,"There are many possible variations on the mutation types above _ For example, three bases may be deleted in a group corresponding to one existing codon _ In this rare instance, there would be no frame shift but a single amino acid would be missing from the encoded protein:"
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation11,Compare the sentences above resulting from different types of mutation: Does the meaning of the message remain recognizable? The activity below will help you summarize key points from your comparison.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation12,"In this activity, we will demonstrate the mutations described above on a short protein sequence."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation13,"Next, we apply the classification above to an actual mutation observed in human DNA _ "
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation14,"The activity below deals with a mutation in the gene that encodes the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin _ The mutation causes hemoglobin to form long rods inside red blood cells _ As a result, it is difficult for the cells to pass through blood vessels _ This leads to a disease called sickle cell anemia in many of those who inherit the mutation."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation15,"The DNA sequence, Protein sequence, and AA position lines need to be reformatted _ In particular the position numbers need fixing so that there are consistent spaces between the numbers; each should be a single digit _ One good way to do this is to use a Table so that all the codons, amino acids, and position numbers are aligned in consistent columns _ The end result should look something like this:"

gene_regulation,molecular_genes_mutation17,Sickle Cell Sequence
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_BRCA1,In this module you learned about the role of DNA as the molecule that stores genetic information _ Any damage to the DNA molecule can have serious consequences for the cell _ There are many different cellular mechanisms to repair DNA damage or to stop a cell with errors in its DNA from dividing _ The BRCA genes code for proteins involved in detecting and repairing double strand breaks in the DNA molecule.
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_BRCA2,"If there is a defect in either of the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, that will result in increased chances of DNA errors, which ultimately can increase the likelihood of cancer _ BRCA genes are therefore considered tumor suppressor genes _ Mutations in these genes produce a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome in affected families."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_BRCA3,"Women with harmful mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 have an increased risk of breast cancer that is about five times the normal risk, and a risk of ovarian cancer that is about 10 to 30 times normal _ While mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for only five to ten percent of all breast cancer cases in women, it is suggested that women with familial breast or ovarian cancer (when several female close relatives have or had cancer) be tested for BRCA mutations _ Testing positive for BRCA mutations does not mean the person will definitely get breast cancer, because there are many other genetic and environmental factors involved _ However, having this information may help those individuals to take preventive measures, such as more frequent mammograms."
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_summary1,The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of information from DNA to protein _ In this module you learned about transcription and translation _ You also learned about mutations (changes in the DNA sequence) and how to predict their effects _ At the end we discussed a real life example in which genes and environmental factors interact to produce an important health outcome (breast and ovarian cancer).
gene_regulation,molecular_genes_summary2,Review the following key terms from this module _ Click on the term to view a definition and additional information.
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_struct_intro1,"You have probably seen Siamese cats--those graceful creatures with darker fur on their faces, tails, and paws _ This is an example of a phenotype dependent on the interaction between genes and environment _ Modern Siamese cats have a defective tyrosinase enzyme; tyrosinase is involved in the synthesis of melanin, the dark pigment of the skin _ This defective enzyme is inactive at normal body temperatures, but it becomes active in cooler areas of the skin _ This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_struct_intro2,"In this module, we will explore the connection between DNA and phenotype on the molecular level _ We will start by clarifying the distinctions between genes, genomes, alleles, and other related terms _ We will compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes and genomes, and we will look at how DNA is packaged into chromosomes with the help of specialized proteins _ We will consider how gene expression can be regulated in the cell by interactions with other genes and environment."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_whats_a_gene1,"Throughout the genetics unit, we have been using the terms gene, allele, and DNA, along with several other related terms _ Before we go on, we need to clarify the relationships among these terms _ First, we need to distinguish between terms that relate to actual molecules and terms that relate to the information content of those molecules _ The macromolecule that carries genetic information is DNA, which in the eukaryotic cell binds specialized proteins to create compact structures called chromosomes."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_whats_a_gene2,"All the hereditary information contained within an organism is called a genome _ The genome includes genes and noncoding DNA sequences _ The human genome, for example, contains the DNA sequence (information) of 22 autosomal chromosomes, as well as the two sex chromosomes X and Y _ The field of study that focuses on the properties of genomes is called genomics, which is related to but distinct from genetics, which focuses on individual genes or a group of genes."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_whats_a_gene3,"Genes carry the information required to produce a functional product (protein or RNA) _ The information is contained in the order of bases in the DNA _ This information is “read” by the cell to produce, first RNA, and then a protein, during a process called gene expression _ When a protein affects an observable characteristic of an organism (remember, observable characteristics represent an organism’s phenotype), the gene encoding that particular protein can be linked to that characteristic or character (e.g., hair color, eye color, or height) _ Traits are specific variations in characteristics (e.g., black hair or blue eyes) _ For example, the gene encoding growth hormone (a protein) affects the height of an individual; in this case, height is the characteristic, and tall or short stature are the traits _ Some genes can be linked to the development of diseases _ Nearly all observable characteristics depend upon multiple genes _ Therefore, when we hear someone refer to the “obesity gene,” “Alzheimer’s gene,” “breast cancer gene,” and so on, it is important to realize that these labels imply (or should imply) one of the multiple genes that contribute to each of these conditions."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_whats_a_gene4,"What is the connection between genes and traits? We must now consider alleles, which are observed variations in the sequence of bases for a particular gene _ Two alleles of a gene may differ by a single base _ On one end of the spectrum, an allele may refer to a total deletion of a gene _ A diploid organism has two alleles of each gene, one from the organism’s mother and one from its father _ The combination of the two alleles of a particular gene is the genetic determinant of the phenotypic traits of the organism _ Note that in addition to genetic factors, environment also contributes to traits _ We will consider environmental effects in a later section _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_whats_a_gene5,"What is the difference between allele and mutation? Any change in the DNA of an organism is called a mutation _ Mutations can be advantageous, harmful, or neutral (in which case they have no effect on the phenotype) _ Mutations include large deletions and rearrangements in the DNA, but they can also be changes in a single base _ Mutation is a more general term than allele because mutation does not necessarily involve a specific gene, but can include deletion or rearrangement of multiple genes _ Multiple alleles of a gene arise by mutation, and they will be passed on to the offspring and will persist in the population."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure1,"In the previous module, we mentioned different kinds of genes _ Some genes produce functional RNA (rRNA and tRNAs), but most genes code for proteins _ Remember that a gene is information residing in the order of bases in a DNA molecule _ The general organization of information of any gene can be represented as follows:"
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure2,"In this module, we will focus on the structure of the protein-coding genes _ A protein-coding gene contains information for making the mRNA that is translated into a protein _ First, let’s consider what kind of information in the mRNA is required to produce a protein during translation, and then we will step back and look at the information in the gene that is required for transcription."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure3,"To encode a protein, mRNA needs a protein-coding region and regulatory regions _ The coding region of the gene (and the coding region of mRNA) has to start with a start codon: ATG in DNA and AUG in mRNA code for the amino acid methionine, Met _ The coding region of a gene always ends with a stop codon TAA, TAG, or TGA (in mRNA, these will have a U instead of a T) _ The sequence between start and stop codons should contain nucleotides in multiples of three, encoding the sequence of amino acids in the protein _ The untranslated regulatory regions (denoted by UTR) include a site for the ribosome to bind before the start codon (5’ UTR) and a region after the stop codon (3’ UTR) _ Both 5’ and 3’ UTRs can bind specific proteins involved in regulation of translation (how fast new protein product is built, how fast mRNA is degraded) _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure4,"Note that mRNA in the figure above starts with 5’ UTR, not with the start codon _ The start codon signals the start of translation, not transcription _ Next, we will consider DNA regions required for transcription."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure5,Genes include regulatory regions at the beginning and the end of the transcribed DNA:
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure6," The promoter region of the gene “promotes” transcription by binding RNA polymerase _ The terminator region signals the end of transcription _ Regulatory regions before and after the transcribed region bind regulatory proteins _ These proteins activate or inhibit transcription, depending on the signals from within the cell or from the environment _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure7,"Putting the regulatory signals associated with RNA production together with those signals on the mRNA, we can represent the central dogma of molecular biology with the following diagram:"
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging1,"After considering individual genes, let’s zoom out and consider a more global view: how genes are organized into genomes."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging2,"The prokaryotic genome resides on a circular piece of double-stranded DNA; there is no membrane to separate DNA from the rest of the cell _ Most bacterial genomes are several million nucleotides long _ The E _ coli genome, for example, is approximately 5 million nucleotides long _ Although this is a relatively small genome, the physical length of the DNA is longer than the length of the bacterial cell _ In order to condense the DNA into a smaller size, the DNA is supercoiled _ In supercoiled DNA, the double helix of the DNA contains additional turns beyond the normal one turn per 10 base pairs _ These additional twists introduce strain into the DNA that is relieved by large-scale twists in the entire DNA molecule, or supercoils _ A good model for supercoiling is an old-fashioned spiral phone cord _ If you form the cord into a circle, and then rotate or twist one of the free ends relative to the other, you will introduce supercoils into the cord."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging3,"Many bacteria contain smaller, circular DNA molecules, called plasmids, in addition to the large DNA molecule that is their chromosome _ Plasmids can replicate independently of the large DNA and can be transferred to other cells _ Some naturally occurring plasmids carry genes encoding toxins and proteins that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging4,"Plasmids provide a very useful tool for biotechnology _ Scientists use them to insert “foreign” genes into bacteria so they can use the bacteria as “factories” to produce desired proteins _ For example, to study a human disease caused by a malfunction in a specific protein, scientists need a large amount of the protein for experiments _ Instead of purifying protein from human cells, scientists can combine coding DNA from the human genome with bacterial regulatory DNA regions on a plasmid, and introduce the plasmid carrying human gene into the bacteria _ Growing a large amount of bacterial cells is much easier than obtaining large amounts of human cells _ Combining DNA from different organisms is called recombinant DNA technology _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging5,"A eukaryotic genome resides on multiple linear DNA molecules in the nucleus _ Each of these DNA molecules is called a chromosome _ Eukaryotic cells also contain DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts; mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are circular like those of bacteria, and are typically considered separately from eukaryotic genomes."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging6,"In general, eukaryotic genomes are much larger than prokaryotic genomes, and they contain a lot more noncoding DNA _ This presents a problem of packaging for eukaryotic -cells: how are they to fit very large DNA into a small compartment? Although eukaryotic DNA is supercoiled, this isn’t enough to solve the packaging problem _ Eukaryotic cells use special proteins (histones) to wind up DNA and fold it into nucleosomes, which are compact structures _ DNA can be transcribed in this state _ Further packaging of DNA into highly compact fibers makes genes inaccessible for transcription, leading to gene silencing _ Gene silencing is an important way of regulating gene expression."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genome_structure_and_packaging7,"The shape of the chromosomes changes throughout the cell cycle _ For example, when a cell needs to divide, DNA is further compacted by the addition of scaffolding proteins that help divide copies of the chromosomes equally _ The most compact shape of the chromosomes can be observed during cell division _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment1,"In the previous sections of this module, we discussed the structure and organization of genes and genomes _ Throughout the molecular genetics module, we have been pointing out the connections between genotype and phenotype _ Here, we will discuss the other important factor in determining the phenotype of an organism: environment _ The effects of environment on phenotype can be fairly subtle or pretty dramatic _ In certain groups of cold-blooded animals, such as Nile crocodiles, sex is determined by an environmental factor: average temperature during the middle third of the incubation period _ Males will only hatch at temperatures between 89.1° and 94.1°F _ Nests with higher or lower temperatures will produce predominantly females."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment2,"How does environment exert its influence on phenotype? Recall that at the molecular and cellular levels, phenotype depends on the molecules produced by the cell _ Production of all molecules is catalyzed by protein enzymes that are encoded by the genome of the organism _ Ultimately, if phenotype depends on protein function, then the environment must have a way of modifying the amount and the activity of proteins _ Using the central dogma of molecular biology, we can deduce that environment may affect protein function at the level of protein, mRNA, or DNA _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment3,"Cells and organisms have to respond to changes in their environment _ An organism that experiences a sudden increase in temperature will respond with increased expression of genes coding for heat-shock proteins; these proteins protect cells from damaged and unfolded proteins _ A bacterial cell that depletes glucose in its environment will not die of starvation if an alternative energy source is available _ In the presence of lactose, bacteria can ""turn on"" the lac operon containing genes required for metabolism of lactose _ Regulation of this operon will be discussed in detail on the next page _ The signaling occurs primarily through binding interactions between molecules and modifications of the proteins that often lead to changes in gene expression _ These changes are short-lived and are not heritable."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment4,"Long-term heritable changes can be produced by the environment at the level of DNA _ Any environmental influence that can damage DNA has the potential to create mutations that can result in changing amino acid sequence of a protein or regulatory information _ For example, high-energy radiation causes double-stranded breaks in DNA that can lead to deletions _ UV light causes single nucleotide changes in DNA _ Environmental toxins and viruses also cause mutations _ Cumulative DNA damage in somatic cells throughout an organism’s lifetime contributes to the aging process _ Only mutations in germ cells result in heritable changes passed on to the next generation of offspring."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment5,"Heritable changes in gene expression can occur via changes in DNA sequence or in DNA packaging _ Mutations in regulatory regions of the gene can lead to increased or decreased protein production without affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein _ One example of such mutation is found in the regulatory region of the human LCT gene on chromosome 2 _ The LCT gene codes for the enzyme lactase, required for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose _ In many adults, expression of the LCT gene is turned off or turned down, resulting in little or no lactase production _ Lack of lactase in the intestines can lead to gastrointestinal distress (bloating, cramps, diarrhea, etc.) after consumption of moderate to large amounts of dairy products, giving rise to a condition called lactose intolerance _ Other people are able to produce lactase well into adulthood _ This ability has been linked to mutations in the regulatory region of the lactase gene that allow gene expression to continue after childhood."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment6,"Heritable changes in DNA packaging do not involve any changes in DNA sequence _ This type of inheritance is epigenetic (from the Greek epi-, meaning over, above, or outside) _ You will recall from the previous page that compact packaging of DNA leads to gene silencing (transcriptionally inactive genes) _ Compact packaging of DNA requires modifications to DNA itself and to histones, which are DNA-binding proteins involved in packaging _ DNA modification involves the addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to specific bases on DNA (cytosine methylation), but does not change the sequence of DNA bases _ The methylation pattern can be preserved during DNA replication, so the daughter cells will have the same methylation pattern as the parent cell _ In germ cells, the pattern of DNA methylation can be passed through the gametes to the next generation of offspring _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment7,"One example of epigenetic silencing in somatic cells is common to all female mammals _ One of the two X chromosomes in females is inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation and histone modifications) _ The results of X-inactivation can be observed in calico or tortoiseshell cats _ These cats are almost always female _ The gene encoding the coat color resides on the X chromosome _ A female cat (with two X chromosomes) could potentially carry one allele for a black coat and one allele for an orange coat _ As a result, her phenotype will end up with patches of two different colors _ This is because cells that inactivate the X chromosome with the black allele will express the orange allele, and after multiple cell divisions, a patch of orange fur will result _ Cells that inactivate the X chromosome carrying the orange allele will give rise to black patches _ The specific pattern of black and orange patches is not heritable because X-inactivation is random _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment8,"Epigenetic regulation and inheritance has been linked to cancer and obesity, aging and longevity, and other important processes _ It is the key mechanism for interactions between genes and environment _ Unlike the genome, which remains fairly unchanged throughout an organism’s life cycle, the epigenome (consisting of the pattern of DNA methylation and histone modifications) is dynamic, responds to the environment, and can be heritable."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment9,"In summary, environment can influence phenotype by interacting with the genome in the following ways:"
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_genes_and_environment10," Environmental signals can change gene expression by affecting regulatory proteins _ Environmental signals can change DNA packaging, which affects gene expression _ Environmental mutagens can cause mutations in DNA _ "
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation1,"In this spotlight, we will explore in more detail changes in gene expression (transcription) due to changes in the environment _ Eukaryotes have complex regulatory mechanisms; consequently, we will focus on gene regulation in prokaryotes _ However, common principles of regulation are used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and an understanding of regulation in prokaryotes will help you understand eukaryotic regulation in future studies."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation2,"Many bacterial genes are expressed at the same time as part of an operon _ The expression of the genes in the operon is controlled by a repressor protein _ The repressor protein will bind to the regulatory region at a DNA sequence _ This sequence is the operator _ When the repressor is bound to the DNA, RNA polymerase cannot transcribe the structural genes because it is blocked by the repressor protein bound on the DNA; under these conditions, none of the enzymes required for the pathway is produced _ Whether or not the repressor binds to the operator is controlled by the binding of a small molecule to the repressor _ The small molecule is either the compound that enters the pathway (for catabolic, or degradative pathways) or the compound that is produced by the pathway (for anabolic, or synthetic pathways) _ The compound binds to the repressor protein and causes the repressor either to bind to the DNA (this is called positive control), turning off transcription, or to be released from the operator site on the DNA (this is called negative control), turning on transcription _ You will explore both of these control mechanisms in the spotlight below."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation3,"Bacteria can use a wide variety of carbon sources as fuel to extract energy for growth _ Two common carbon sources are the sugars glucose and lactose (milk sugar) _ Glucose is a monosaccharide containing one six-membered ring, while lactose is a disaccharide made of glucose linked to galactose."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation4,"It is less efficient for bacteria to use lactose as an energy source because they must take additional steps to convert lactose into a form that can be used to extract energy _ Each of these steps requires the synthesis of an enzyme, which is costly to the bacteria _ Consequently, bacteria prefer to use glucose rather than lactose as a fuel source when both sugars are present _ However, when lactose is present and glucose is not, the bacteria “turn on,” or synthesize, the enzymes required for lactose metabolism, allowing the bacteria to use lactose for energy."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation5,"The genes for lactose metabolism are contained in an operon known as the lac operon _ The lac operon is controlled by the lac repressor, which is produced from the lacI gene _ The lacI gene has its own promoter; consequently, low levels of the lac repressor protein are present all of the time _ Three structural genes in the operon, lacZ, lacY, and lacA, encode enzymes required for lactose metabolism."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation6,"Thus far, we have described what happens when either glucose is present or lactose is present _ If both are present, glucose is used first by the bacteria, and only very small amounts of the enzymes for lactose metabolism are made _ Complete the following Learn by Doing to understand how glucose turns off the lac operon, even if lactose is present."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_regulation7,"The enzymes for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan are contained in the Trp operon _ The structure of this operon is shown below _ The trp repressor binds the amino acid tryptophan, the end product of the biosynthesis of tryptophan (trp) _ As you can see, it has the same structure as the lac operon, but it contains more genes for the biosynthesis of trp."
gene_regulation,genetics_molecular_gene_structure_summary1,"Manipulation of DNA has opened an incredible array of possibilities for humanity _ From the industrial production of biological molecules in bacteria, to gene therapy, biotechnology has brought dramatic changes to medicine, agriculture, forensics, and many other disciplines _ In this module you revisited how a gene can be inserted and expressed in a bacterium _ making possible the large scale production of an important hormone."
